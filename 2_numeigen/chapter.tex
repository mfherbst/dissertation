\chapter{Numerical treatment of spectral problems}

	It is a well-known experience that the only truly
	enjoyable and profitable way of studying mathematics
	is the method of ``filling in details'' by one's
	own efforts.
}{Cornelius Lanczos~(1893--1974)}

\noindent
This chapter discusses numerical techniques
and algorithms,
which can be used for obtaining a few of the discrete
eigenvalues and corresponding eigenstates
of a self-adjoint operator.
For simplifying the discussion we will restrict ourselves
to the cases where the eigenvalues of interest
are located at the lower end of the discrete spectrum
and are well-separated from the essential part of the spectrum.
