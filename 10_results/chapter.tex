In this chapter we will discuss preliminary computational results
obtained from quantum-chemical calculations using Coulomb-Sturmian
basis functions inside the \linebreak \molsturm framework.
The focus will be on discussing and understanding the convergence
properties of \CS-based calculations on atoms of
the second and the third period of the periodic table,
mostly at Hartree-Fock level.
Some exemplary Full-CI and {\MP}2 calculations have been performed
as well to get some idea how the picture changes
if correlation effects are taken into account as well.

Based on these results we will discuss some
preliminary guidelines for selecting \CS basis set parameters,
like the angular momentum restrictions or the Sturmian exponent $\kexp$,
where the overall aim is to yield rapid convergence
of the ground state energies at \HF or correlated level.
Finally we present the first results of a \CS-based
excited states calculation at \ADC-(2) level.
