\section{Sturmian-based ADC}
%
% Maybe show a single Be ADC calculation to show that it can be done
%

% For potassium l_max = m_max = 2 seems to be good for HF
% Do some more calculations to check the correlation effects
%
% We want the potassium 30s atomic orbital

\todo[inline,caption={}]{
	\begin{itemize}
		% TODO Can we actually do this?
		% Try to do the orbital rotation thingy
		\item hint at it or show some examples
		\item Maybe show comparison of convergence rates (rel. error vs. basis size)
			in the sensible Sturmian $nlm$ basis sets vs similar Gaussian ones
		\item Look at how the Gaussian basis sets have been constructed
			(especially the correlation consistent and pc-n ones)
			and compare how the Sturmians behave if similar
			Constructions are used, also motivated from the previous section.
	\end{itemize}
