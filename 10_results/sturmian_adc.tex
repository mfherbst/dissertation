\section{Sturmian-based ADC}
todoil{TODO}
%
% Maybe show a single Be ADC calculation to show that it can be done
%



Beryllium computed and experimental absorption spectra~\cite{Serrao1985}
% 1E_h = 2Ry

plot with 2s2p, 2s3s, 2s3d, 2s4s and so on



% TODO OPTIONAL
% For potassium l_max = m_max = 2 seems to be good for HF
% Do some more calculations to check the correlation effects
%
% We want the potassium 30s atomic orbital
%\todo[inline,caption={}]{
%	\begin{itemize}
%		% TODO Can we actually do this?
%		% Try to do the orbital rotation thingy
%		\item hint at it or show some examples
%		\item Maybe show comparison of convergence rates (rel. error vs. basis size)
%			in the sensible Sturmian $nlm$ basis sets vs similar Gaussian ones
%		\item Look at how the Gaussian basis sets have been constructed
%			(especially the correlation consistent and pc-n ones)
%			and compare how the Sturmians behave if similar
%			Constructions are used, also motivated from the previous section.
