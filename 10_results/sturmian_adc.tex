\section{Coulomb-Sturmian-based ADC calculations}
This section provides a first look into excited states calculations
employing Coulomb-Sturmians as the underlying basis functions.
As mentioned in section \vref{sec:MolsturmState} the modular design
of the \molsturm package allowed us to link it to a few third-party
packages employing our \python interface.
One of them is \adcman~\cite{Wormit2014},
which can be employed to perform excited states calculations
based on the algebraic diagrammatic construction scheme at
{\ADC}(1), {\ADC}(2), {\ADC}(2)-x~\cite{Schirmer1982}
and {\ADC}(3)~\cite{Trofimov1999} level.

This section now reports the first successful {\ADC}(2)
calculation employing Coulomb-Sturmians for the discretisation
on the beryllium atom.
In figure \ref{fig:KoptVsAtnum} we show the singlet excitation energies
as a progression with increasing \CS basis set size from $(4,1,1)$ to $(10,1,1)$.
For comparison the figure also indicates an equivalent calculation
using cc-pVTZ~\cite{Prascher2011} as well as the experimental values~\cite{Moore1949}.
Within the \CS basis set progression the results converge nicely from above.
Compared to cc-pVTZ the $(10,1,1)$ basis set
performs worse at the first excited state $2s2p$~($\unit[1.0]{eV}$ versus $\unit[0.6]{eV}$ error) but significantly better for the $2s3s$ and the $2s3p$ states,
where the cc-pVTZ error is four times as large
for $2s3s$~($\unit[2.2]{eV}$ versus $\unit[0.5]{eV}$)
and twice as large for $2s3p$~($\unit[2.0]{eV}$ versus $\unit[1.2]{eV}$).

When it comes to the comparison with experiment there are more
errors to consider than just the discretisation error.
In our treatment we neglect relativistic effects
and {\ADC}(2) as an approximate method for solving excited states
of the electronic Schr√∂dinger equation naturally contains
an intrinsic method error as well.
Nevertheless the initial results we have presented
seem to suggest that Coulomb-Sturmians
are able to give a more balanced description of more than one state
compared to \cGTO basis functions.
For this reason they could be a promising alternative
for modelling excited states phenomena.


% TODO OPTIONAL
% For potassium l_max = m_max = 2 seems to be good for HF
% Do some more calculations to check the correlation effects
%
% We want the potassium 30s atomic orbital
