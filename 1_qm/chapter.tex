At the turn of the 19th century it was discovered
that classical mechanics in the formulations provided
by Joseph-Louis Lagrange and William Rowan Hamilton
is not able to capture all effects observed in experiments.
Especially the phenomenon of the black-body radiation spectrum,
but also the photoelectric effect could not be explained.
Finally in 1900 Max Planck somewhat reluctantly introduced the idea of discrete,
i.e. quantised, energy levels
in order to explain the black-body radiation spectrum,
building on earlier ideas by Ludwig Boltzmann.
This started the development of a quantised theory of mechanics
with major contributions by nowadays famous names such as
Niels Bohr, Max Born, Louis de Broglie, Paul Dirac, Albert Einstein,
Vladimir Fock, Pascual Jordan, John von Neumann, Erwin Schr√∂dinger
and others.

In this chapter we will discuss the mathematical structure
of quantum mechanics in light of the problems of atomic physics
and quantum chemistry.
The discussion will focus on the mathematical fields of functional
analysis and spectral theory as these are key in order
to understand the peculiarities with computing discrete energy levels.
The connection to atomic physics is made clear wherever possible.
The parts of the chapter, where we build up the required
mathematical language might seem rather technical, still.
In the chapter we follow the excellent material by \citet{Shankar1994},
\citet{Mueller2000} and \citet{Helffer2013}.
