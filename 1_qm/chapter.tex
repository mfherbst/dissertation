\chapter{Mathematical structure of quantum mechanics}
\chapquote{
	Whenever we proceed from the known into the unknown we
	may hope to understand,
	but we may have to learn at the same time a new
	meaning of the word ``understanding''.
}{Werner Heisenberg~(1901--1976)}

At the turn of the 19th century it was discovered
that classical mechanics in the formulations provided
by Lagrange, Hamilton and Poission
are not able to capture all effects experimentially observed.
This lead to the alternative theory of Quantum Mechanics,
which was developed in close analogy to the classical formulation.

In this chapter we will discuss the mathematical structure
of quantum mechanics in light of the problems of atomic phyics
and quantum chemistry.
Our discussion will focus on explaining both the mathematical
peculiarities of quantum mechanics as well as hinting
at the tricks required to make progress in a physical setting.
We follow mostly the excellent material by \citet{Shankar1994},
\citet{Mueller2000}, \citet{Davies2007} and \citet{Helffer2013} is our discussion.
