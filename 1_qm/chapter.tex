At the turn of the 19th century it was discovered
that classical mechanics in the formulations provided
by Lagrange, Hamilton and Poission
are not able to capture all effects observed in experiments.
Especially the phenomenon of the blackbody radiation spectrum,
but also the photoelectric effect could not be explained by the available theory.
Finally in 1900 Max Planck somewhat reluctantly introduced the idea of
discrete, i.e. quantised, energy levels
in order to explain the blackbody radiation spectrum,
building on earlier ideas by Ludwig Boltzmann.
This started the development of a quantised theory of mechanics
with major contributions by nowadays famous
names such as Niels Bohr, Max Born, Louis de Broglie, Paul Dirac, Albert Einstein, Vladimir Fock, Pascual Jordan, John von Neumann, Erwin Schr√∂dinger and many more.

In this chapter we will discuss the mathematical structure
of quantum mechanics in light of the problems of atomic physics
and quantum chemistry.
Our discussion will focus on explaining both the mathematical
peculiarities of quantum mechanics as well as hinting
at the tricks required to make progress in a physical setting.
We follow mostly the excellent material by \citet{Shankar1994},
\citet{Mueller2000} and \citet{Helffer2013} is our discussion.
