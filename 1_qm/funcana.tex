Sobolev spaces lift 



\begin{defn}
	% bounded
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	A metric space $M$ is complete if every sequence in $M$
	which is Cauchy converges to a limit, which is in $M$ as well.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	A set is compact if it is bounded and complete.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	A subset $S$ is dense in a complete metric space $M$ if it is a proper subset
	and each sequence in $S$ which is Cauchy converges to a point in $M$.
\end{defn}

$C^\infty_0$ is dense in $L^2$ (Hachbusch 1986)
and dense in $H^1$

also define $H_0^n(\Omega, \C)$
Give inclusions including $C^\infty_0$
Mention what is dense
