Thanks to the people who read the thesis


I greatefully acknowledge the computational time at the octuplet cluster at
the eScience group of KÃ¸penhavns Universitet, which was used to carry out
most of the calculations in chapter 8

Powered by chaos and the ease by which one gets it touch with novel ideas.

A fascinating aspect of quantum chemistry is the interdisciplinarity of the field.
Developing a good quantum-chemical model for a particular aspect of chemistry
firstly requires both chemical as well as physical intuition.
But in many cases the arising problems are numerically challenging
and for solving them in an efficient and reliable manner
one cannot avoid taking a deeper look into the mathematical structures
as well as modern concepts from high-performance computing,
hardware and operating systems design.
Embedded in this interdisciplinary setting,
this thesis will develop the mathematical language of quantum mechanics
and apply it to a subfield of quantum chemistry,
namely electronic structure theory.
The overall aim is the development of novel computational methods
for the modelling of electronic properties of matter.
