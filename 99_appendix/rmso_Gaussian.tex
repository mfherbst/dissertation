\chapter{$\RMSOl$ plots for \cGTO discretisations}
\label{apx:GaussianUHF}

This appendix shows $\RMSOl$~(see definition \vref{defn:RMSOl})
plots for the \cGTO basis sets
cc-pV5Z and cc-pV6Z%
~\cite{Dunning1989,Woon1993,Wilson1996,VanMourik2000,Prascher2011}
similar to the ones depicted for \CS discretisations
in section \vref{sec:CSconvergenceHF}.
The values were computed \molsturm~\cite{molsturmWeb,molsturmDesign}
using \libint~\cite{Libint2_231} as a back end
for the integral values.
The most notable differences compared to figures \ref{fig:RMSOl_period2}
and \vref{fig:RMSOl_period3}
is that the $\RMSOl$ of lithium and phosphorus
decreases much slower and
that beryllium has some pronounced spikes of larger $\RMSOl$
values for $l=2$ and $l=4$.
