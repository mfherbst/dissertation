The tables presented in this appendix,
show computed ground state energies for the atoms of the second
and third period of the periodic table
at Hartree-Fock and second-order MÃ¸ller-Plesset perturbation theory level.
For each atom only one \CS exponent $\kexp$,
but a range of \CS basis sets is employed.
Table C.1 continues on the next page.
