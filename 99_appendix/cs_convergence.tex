\chapter{Computational results of the Coulomb-Sturmian correlation convergence study}
\label{apx:CSCorrelationConvergence}

% TODO Maybe also plot convergence of Be FCI with the basis sets
%      we did computations with.

		at Hartree-Fock, MP2 and Full-CI level of theory.
		For all calculations $\kexp = 1.985$ was used.
		The heading of the table shows the values for
		$(\nmax, \lmax, \mmax)$ as well as the
		number of basis functions
		in the truncated CS basis.}

The data in this appendix shows the CS HF and MP2 energies
for various nlm values but the same k
