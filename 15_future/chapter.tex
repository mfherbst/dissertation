% molsturm
A good improvement for \molsturm on this front would be a cheap,
but nevertheless effective \contraction-based \SCF scheme.
%

A disadvantage of the current \molsturm interface is,
that all data is stored as plain and dense memory.
Both symmetry as well as sparsity properties of the involved tensors
are entirely ignored at the moment.
This yields an unacceptably large requirement in memory
as well as a very unfavourable computational scaling
for the demanding tensor contractions
typically required in Post-HF methods like \CCD (see figure \ref{fig:codeCCD}).
In the future we want to tackle this by extending
\lazyten towards lazy tensors as well.
In practice this would imply that the evaluation of
tensor contractions like in figure \ref{fig:codeCCD} could be implicitly delayed
for as long as possible.
Only once the results are needed in the code,
the calculation would be underdone
for all delayed expressions at once.
This could allow to automatically deduce an ideal evaluation strategy
taking all sparsity and symmetry information
of the involved tensors into account.
Ideally this would happen transparently in the background
without changing the \python interface at all.

Another angle for future work would be to integrate more closely
with existing quantum-chemistry libraries or program packages.
A good example is the \texttt{libxc}~\cite{Lehtola2018} library,
which offers a range of exchange-correlation functionals.
Implementing an interface to this library inside appropriate
lazy matrix objects would allow to construct the Kohn-Sham matrix
inside \molsturm's \contraction-based \SCF as well,
such that density-functional theory~(DFT) calculations
could be performed.
Similarly we would like to simplify
data exchange with other quantum chemistry packages like \pyscf or \psifour
by supporting some wide-spread file formats in quantum chemistry,
\eg \texttt{MolPro}'s FCIDUMP~\cite{Knowles1989}.
For facilitating plotting of \SCF orbitals or densities
we plan to implement the \texttt{molden}~\cite{Schaftenaar2000} format
as well as routines for dumping the data
in \texttt{Gaussian}~\cite{Frisch2016} cube or VTK~\cite{Avila2010} files.
