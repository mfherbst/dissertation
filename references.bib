  abstract  = {This book describes the generalized Sturmian method, which offers a fresh approach to the calculation of atomic spectra. Generalized Sturmians are isoenergetic solutions to an approximate many-electron Schrödinger equation with a weighted potential. The weighting factors are chosen in such a way as to make all of the solutions correspond to a given energy. The advantage of such an isoenergetic basis set is that every basis function has the correct turning point behavior needed for efficient synthesis of the wave function. The book also discusses methods for automatic generation of symmetry-adapted basis sets. Calculations using the generalized Sturmian method are presented and compared with experimental results from the NIST database. The relationship of Sturmians to harmonic polynomials and hyperspherical harmonics is also described. Methods for treating angular functions and angular integrals by means of harmonic projection are discussed, and these methods are shown to be especially useful for relativistic calculations. A final chapter discusses application of the generalized Sturmian method to the calculation of molecular spectra.},

  abstract  = {In theoretical physics, theoretical chemistry and engineering, one often wishes to solve partial differential equations subject to a set of boundary conditions. This gives rise to eigenvalue problems of which some solutions may be very difficult to find. For example, the problem of finding eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for the Hamiltonian of a many-particle system is usually so difficult that it requires approximate methods, the most common of which is expansion of the eigenfunctions in terms of basis functions that obey the boundary conditions of the problem. The computational effort needed in such problems can be much reduced by making use of symmetry-adapted basis functions. The conventional method for generating symmetry-adapted basis sets is through the application of group theory, but this can be difficult. This book describes an easier method for generating symmetry-adapted basis sets automatically with computer techniques. The method has a wide range of applicability, and can be used to solve difficult eigenvalue problems in a number of fields. The book is of special interest to quantum theorists, computer scientists, computational chemists and applied mathematicians.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, details of an implementation of a numerical code for computing the Kohn–Sham equations are presented and discussed. A fully self-consistent method of solving the quantum many-body problem within the context of density functional theory using a real-space method based on finite element discretisation of realspace is considered. Various numerical issues are explored such as (i) initial mesh motion aimed at co-aligning ions and vertices; (ii) a priori and a posteriori optimization of the mesh based on Kelly's error estimate; (iii) the influence of the quadrature rule and variation of the polynomial degree of interpolation in the finite element discretisation on the resulting total energy. Additionally, (iv) explicit, implicit and Gaussian approaches to treat the ionic potential are compared. A quadrupole expansion is employed to provide boundary conditions for the Poisson problem. To exemplify the soundness of our method, accurate computations are performed for hydrogen, helium, lithium, carbon, oxygen, neon, the hydrogen molecule ion and the carbon-monoxide molecule. Our methods, algorithms and implementation are shown to be stable with respect to convergence of the total energy in a parallel computational environment. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {The algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC) scheme for the polarization propagator provides a series of ab initio methods for the calculation of excited states based on perturbation theory. In recent years, the second-order ADC(2) scheme has attracted attention in the computational chemistry community because of its reliable accuracy and reasonable computational effort in the calculation of predominantly singly excited states. Owing to their size-consistency, ADC methods are suited for the investigation of large molecules. In addition, their Hermitian structure and the availability of the intermediate state representation (ISR) allow for straightforward computation of excited-state properties. Recently, an efficient implementation of ADC(3) has been reported, and its high accuracy for typical valence excited states of organic chromophores has been demonstrated. In this review, the origin of ADC-based excited-state methods in propagator theory is described, and an intuitive route for the derivation of algebraic expressions via the ISR is outlined and comparison to other excited-state methods is made. Existing computer codes and implemented ADC variants are reviewed, but most importantly the accuracy and limits of different ADC schemes are critically examined.Conflict of interest: The authors have declared no conflicts of interest for this article.For further resources related to this article, please visit the WIREs website.},

After outlining a class of MCHF problems, the derivation of the MCHF equations is reviewed and some theory developed on the variation of the energy functional with respect to a rotation of the orbital basis among orbitals of the same symmetry. Various procedures are proposed and evaluated for dealing with cases where the radial basis for a given total energy is not unique.

  abstract  = {The newest version of the two-dimensional finite difference Hartree–Fock program for atoms and diatomic molecules is presented. This is an updated and extended version of the program published in this journal in 1996. It can be used to obtain reference, Hartree–Fock limit values of total energies and multipole moments for a wide range of diatomic molecules and their ions in order to calibrate existing and develop new basis sets, calculate (hyper)polarizabilities ( α z z , β z z z , γ z z z z , A z,zz , B z z , z z ) of atoms, homonuclear and heteronuclear diatomic molecules and their ions via the finite field method, perform DFT-type calculations using \{LDA\} or \{B88\} exchange functionals and \{LYP\} or \{VWN\} correlations ones or the self-consistent multiplicative constant method, perform one-particle calculations with (smooth) Coulomb and Krammers–Henneberger potentials and take account of finite nucleus models. The program is easy to install and compile (tarball+configure+make) and can be used to perform calculations within double- or quadruple-precision arithmetic.

Ireland Licensing provisions: \{GNU\} General Public License version 2 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 171196 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 9481802 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Fortran 77, C. Computer: any 32- or 64-bit platform. Operating system: Unix/Linux. RAM: Case dependent, from few \{MB\} to many \{GB\} Classification: 16.1. Catalogue identifier of previous version: ADEB_v1_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 98(1996)346 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: The program finds virtually exact solutions of the Hartree–Fock and density functional theory type equations for atoms, diatomic molecules and their ions. The lowest energy eigenstates of a given irreducible representation and spin can be obtained. The program can be used to perform one-particle calculations with (smooth) Coulomb and Krammers–Henneberger potentials and also DFT-type calculations using \{LDA\} or \{B88\} exchange functionals and \{LYP\} or \{VWN\} correlations ones or the self-consistent multiplicative constant method. Solution method: Single-particle two-dimensional numerical functions (orbitals) are used to construct an antisymmetric many-electron wave function of the restricted open-shell Hartree–Fock model. The orbitals are obtained by solving the Hartree–Fock equations as coupled two-dimensional second-order (elliptic) partial differential equations (PDEs). The Coulomb and exchange potentials are obtained as solutions of the corresponding Poisson equations. The \{PDEs\} are discretized by the eighth-order central difference stencil on a two-dimensional single grid, and the resulting large and sparse system of linear equations is solved by the (multicolour) successive overrelaxation ((MC)SOR) method. The self-consistent-field iterations are interwoven with the (MC)SOR ones and orbital energies and normalization factors are used to monitor the convergence. The accuracy of solutions depends mainly on the grid and the system under consideration, which means that within double precision arithmetic one can obtain orbitals and energies having up to 12 significant figures. If more accurate results are needed, quadruple-precision floating-point arithmetic can be used. Reasons for new version: Additional features, many modifications and corrections, improved convergence rate, overhauled code and documentation. Summary of revisions: see ChangeLog found in tar.gz archive Restrictions: The present version of the program is restricted to 60 orbitals. The maximum grid size is determined at compilation time. Unusual features: The program uses two C routines for allocating and deallocating memory. Several \{BLAS\} (Basic Linear Algebra System) routines are emulated by the program. When possible they should be replaced by their library equivalents. Additional comments: automake and autoconf tools are required to build and compile the program; checked with f77, gfortran and ifort compilers Running time: Very case dependent — from a few \{CPU\} seconds for the \{H2\} defined on a small grid up to several weeks for the Hartree–Fock-limit calculations for 40–50 electron molecules. },

This method needs storage only for a few vectors (five to seven, depending on the implementation), making it practical for very large problems where disk storage is the limiting factor, without the necessity of restarting or discarding some expansion vectors. The convergence characteristics of the modified method are essentially identical with those of the original Davidson method if all expansion vectors are retained in the latter.},

  abstract  = {We review the application of the finite element (FE) method to ab initio electronic structure calculations in solids. The FE method is a general approach for the solution of differential and integral equations which uses a strictly local, piecewise-polynomial basis. Because the basis is composed of polynomials, the method is completely general and its accuracy is systematically improvable. Because the basis is strictly local in real space, the method allows for variable resolution in real space; produces sparse, structured matrices, enabling the effective use of iterative solution methods; and is well suited for parallel implementation. The method thus combines significant advantages of both real-space-grid and basis-oriented approaches, and so is well suited for large, accurate ab initio calculations. We review the construction and properties of the required FE bases and their use in the self-consistent solution of the Kohn–Sham equations of density functional theory.},

The basis functions and the electron density are projected on a real-space grid, in order to calculate the Hartree and exchange-correlation potentials and matrix elements, with a number of operations that scales linearly with the size of the system. We use a modified energy functional, whose minimization produces orthogonal wavefunctions and the same energy and density as the Kohn-Sham energy functional, without the need for an explicit orthogonalization. Additionally, using localized Wannier-like electron wavefunctions allows the computation time and memory required to minimize the energy to also scale linearly with the size of the system. Forces and stresses are also calculated efficiently and accurately, thus allowing structural relaxation and molecular dynamics simulations.},

These can be used in connexion with the molecular orbital method, or localized bond method, or the general method of treating linear combinations of many Slater determinants by the variational procedure. This general method of obtaining a sequence of solutions converging to the accurate solution is examined. It is shown that the only obstacle to the evaluation of wave functions of any required degree of accuracy is the labour of computation.

  abstract = {Electronic structure calculations have become an indispensable tool in many areas of materials science and quantum chemistry. Even though the Kohn–Sham formulation of the density-functional theory (DFT) simplifies the many-body problem significantly, one is still confronted with several numerical challenges. In this article we present the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method as implemented in the GPAW program package ( https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw [https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw] ) using a uniform real-space grid representation of the electronic wavefunctions. Compared to more traditional plane wave or localized basis set approaches, real-space grids offer several advantages, most notably good computational scalability and systematic convergence properties. However, as a unique feature GPAW also facilitates a localized atomic-orbital basis set in addition to the grid. The efficient atomic basis set is complementary to the more accurate grid, and the possibility to seamlessly switch between the two representations provides great flexibility. While DFT allows one to study ground state properties, time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) provides access to the excited states. We have implemented the two common formulations of TDDFT, namely the linear-response and the time propagation schemes. Electron transport calculations under finite-bias conditions can be performed with GPAW using non-equilibrium Green functions and the localized basis set. In addition to the basic features of the real-space PAW method, we also describe the implementation of selected exchange–correlation functionals, parallelization schemes, ΔSCF-method, x-ray absorption spectra, and maximally localized Wannier orbitals.},

  abstract = {Based on a generalization of the method of Sturmian expansions to the case of many-electron systems, a fundamentally new approach was developed for the construction of a complete set of intermediate states in many-body perturbation theory thereby avoiding integration over states of the continuous spectrum. A complete system of eigenfunctions of the generalized eigenvalue problem for the one-electron Hartree-Fock equation with a factor before the energy operator and fixed values of the Lagrange multipliers is used as a basis of single-particle virtual orbitals for an initial approximation to the eigenfunctions of the Hartree-Fock self-consistent field method. In the case of bound states, the spectrum of the effective operator is purely discrete, thus permitting one to completely eliminate integration over continuum virtual orbitals in applying methods of many-body perturbation theory to atomic and molecular calculations for a number of cases. As a consequence, one manages to avoid a number of the technical difficulties associated with inclusion of such states. The possibilities of the developed approach are illustrated in application to the investigation of the interaction of many-electron atoms with external fields.},

These stochastic methods are based on many-body wavefunctions and are capable of achieving very high accuracy. The algorithms are intrinsically parallel and well suited to implementation on petascale computers, and the computational cost scales as a polynomial in the number of particles. A guide to the systems and topics which have been investigated using these methods is given. The bulk of the article is devoted to an overview of the basic quantum Monte Carlo methods, the forms and optimization of wavefunctions, performing calculations under periodic boundary conditions, using pseudopotentials, excited-state calculations, sources of calculational inaccuracy, and calculating energy differences and forces.},

  abstract  = {We resume the recent successes of the grid-based tensor numerical methods and discuss their prospects in real-space electronic structure calculations. These methods{,} based on the low-rank representation of the multidimensional functions and integral operators{,} first appeared as an accurate tensor calculus for the 3D Hartree potential using 1D complexity operations{,} and have evolved to entirely grid-based tensor-structured 3D Hartree-Fock eigenvalue solver. It benefits from tensor calculation of the core Hamiltonian and two-electron integrals (TEI) in O(n log n) complexity using the rank-structured approximation of basis functions{,} electron densities and convolution integral operators all represented on 3D n [times] n [times] n Cartesian grids. The algorithm for calculating TEI tensor in a form of the Cholesky decomposition is based on multiple factorizations using algebraic 1D {"}density fitting{"} scheme{,} which yield an almost irreducible number of product basis functions involved in the 3D convolution integrals{,} depending on a threshold ? > 0. The basis functions are not restricted to separable Gaussians{,} since the analytical integration is substituted by high-precision tensor-structured numerical quadratures. The tensor approaches to post-Hartree-Fock calculations for the MP2 energy correction and for the Bethe-Salpeter excitation energies{,} based on using low-rank factorizations and the reduced basis method{,} were recently introduced. Another direction is towards the tensor-based Hartree-Fock numerical scheme for finite lattices{,} where one of the numerical challenges is the summation of electrostatic potentials of a large number of nuclei. The 3D grid-based tensor method for calculation of a potential sum on a L [times] L [times] L lattice manifests the linear in L computational work{,} O(L){,} instead of the usual O(L3 log L) scaling by the Ewald-type approaches.},

In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple ‘for-loop’ construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.},

  abstract  = {With advances in algorithms and growing computing powers, quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods have become a leading contender for high accuracy calculations for the electronic structure of realistic systems. The performance gain on recent HPC systems is largely driven by increasing parallelism: the number of compute cores of a SMP and the number of SMPs have been going up, as the Top500 list attests. However, the available memory as well as the communication and memory bandwidth per element has not kept pace with the increasing parallelism. This severely limits the applicability of QMC and the problem size it can handle. OpenMP/MPI hybrid programming provides applications with simple but effective solutions to overcome efficiency and scalability bottlenecks on large-scale clusters based on multi/many-core SMPs. We discuss the design and implementation of hybrid methods in QMCPACK and analyze its performance on current HPC platforms characterized by various memory and communication hierarchies.},

  abstract  = {Algorithms and working expressions for a grid-based fast multipole method (GB-FMM) have been developed and implemented. The computational domain is divided into cubic subdomains{,} organized in a hierarchical tree. The contribution to the electrostatic interaction energies from pairs of neighboring subdomains is computed using numerical integration{,} whereas the contributions from further apart subdomains are obtained using multipole expansions. The multipole moments of the subdomains are obtained by numerical integration. Linear scaling is achieved by translating and summing the multipoles according to the tree structure{,} such that each subdomain interacts with a number of subdomains that are almost independent of the size of the system. To compute electrostatic interaction energies of neighboring subdomains{,} we employ an algorithm which performs efficiently on general purpose graphics processing units (GPGPU). Calculations using one CPU for the FMM part and 20 GPGPUs consisting of tens of thousands of execution threads for the numerical integration algorithm show the scalability and parallel performance of the scheme. For calculations on systems consisting of Gaussian functions ([small alpha] = 1) distributed as fullerenes from C20 to C720{,} the total computation time and relative accuracy (ppb) are independent of the system size.},

  abstract = {Molden is a software package for pre- and postprocessing of computational chemistry program data. Interfacing to the ab initio programs Gamess-US/UK and Gaussian and to the semi-empirical package MOPAC is provided. The emphasis is on computation and visualization of electronic and molecular properties but, e.g., reaction pathways can be simulated as well. Some molecular properties of interest are processed directly from the output of the computational chemistry programs, others are calculated in MOLDEN before display. The package features different options to display MOLecular electronic DENsity, each focusing on a different structural aspect: molecular orbitals, electron density, molecular minus atomic density and the Laplacian of the electron density. To display difference density, either the spherically averaged atomic density or the oriented ground state atomic density can be used for a number of standard basis sets. The quantum mechanical electrostatic potential or a distributed multipole expansion derived electrostatic potential can be calculated and atomic charges can be fitted to these potentials calculated on Connolly surface(s). Reaction pathways and molecular vibrations can be visualized. Input structures can be generated with a Z-matrix editor. A variety of graphics languages is supported: XWindows, postscript, VRML and Povray format.},

  abstract = {Abstract libxc is a library of exchange–correlation functionals for density-functional theory. We are concerned with semi-local functionals (or the semi-local part of hybrid functionals), namely local-density approximations, generalized-gradient approximations, and meta-generalized-gradient approximations. Currently we include around 400 functionals for the exchange, correlation, and the kinetic energy, spanning more than 50 years of research. Moreover, libxc is by now used by more than 20 codes, not only from the atomic, molecular, and solid-state physics, but also from the quantum chemistry communities. },

We make use of a large-Z approximation, which leads to extremely simple closed-form expressions not only for energies, but also for values of the electronic potential at the nucleus. The method predicts approximately piecewise linear dependence of the core-ionization energies on the number of electrons N for isonuclear series, and an approximately linear dependence of $\Delta$E − Z                        2/2 on the nuclear charge Z for isoelectronic series.},

In particular, conditions that the discrete spectrum of this operator be finite are obtained. The results of the work are applicable to certain specific quantum systems, for example, to univalent negative atomic ions and to diatomic molecules. Bibliography: 20 titles.},

  abstract = {The Gaussian Product Theorem between two 1s Gaussian Type Orbitals (GTOs) is extended to an arbitrary number of s-type functions, giving a compact formula which permits to express the condensed GTO result. Then, this new formulation is combined with the product of arbitrary GTO Cartesian angular parts, obtaining a finite expansion expressing this product as a multilinear combination of such functions sharing a common center. The combination of both results constitutes the General Gaussian Product Theorem (GGPT), a final compact expression for the product of an arbitrary number of Cartesian GTOs. The notation provides an easy way to express algebraically any general multicenter GTO product expression. It is also shown how by means of Nested Summation Symbols the computational implementation can be easily and elegantly achieved. Computational parallelizable schemes of the GGPT are provided.},

In this paper we analyse the complexity (storage, addition, multiplication and inversion) of the hierarchical matrix arithmetics. Two criteria, the sparsity and idempotency, are sufficient to give the desired bounds. For standard finite element and boundary element applications we present a construction of the hierarchical matrix format for which we can give explicit bounds for the sparsity and idempotency.},

  abstract  = {Universal variational functionals of densities, first-order density matrices, and natural spin-orbitals are explicitly displayed for variational calculations of ground states of interacting electrons in atoms, molecules, and solids. In all cases, the functionals search for constrained minima. In particular, following Percus [Formula: see text] is identified as the universal functional of Hohenberg and Kohn for the sum of the kinetic and electron{\textemdash}electron repulsion energies of an N-representable trial electron density ρ. Q[ρ] searches all antisymmetric wavefunctions Ψρ which yield the fixed. ρ. Q[ρ] then delivers that expectation value which is a minimum. Similarly, [Formula: see text] is shown to be the universal functional for the electron{\textemdash}electron repulsion energy of an N-representable trial first-order density matrix γ, where the actual external potential may be nonlocal as well as local. These universal functions do not require that a trial function for a variational calculation be associated with a ground state of some external potential. Thus, the v-representability problem, which is especially severe for trial first-order density matrices, has been solved. Universal variational functionals in Hartree{\textemdash}Fock and other restricted wavefunction theories are also presented. Finally, natural spin-orbital functional theory is compared with traditional orbital formulations in density functional theory.},

  abstract  = {Tensor operations are surging as the computational building blocks for a variety of scientific simulations and the development of high-performance kernels for such operations is known to be a challenging task. While for operations on one- and two-dimensional tensors there exist standardized interfaces and highly-optimized libraries (BLAS), for higher dimensional tensors neither standards nor highly-tuned implementations exist yet. In this paper, we consider contractions between two tensors of arbitrary dimensionality and take on the challenge of generating high-performance implementations by resorting to sequences of BLAS kernels. The approach consists in breaking the contraction down into operations that only involve matrices or vectors. Since in general there are many alternative ways of decomposing a contraction, we are able to methodically derive a large family of algorithms. The main contribution of this paper is a systematic methodology to accurately identify the fastest algorithms in the bunch, without executing them. The goal is instead accomplished with the help of a set of cache-aware micro-benchmarks for the underlying BLAS kernels. The predictions we construct from such benchmarks allow us to reliably single out the best-performing algorithms in a tiny fraction of the time taken by the direct execution of the algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Precise calculation of molecular electronic wavefunctions by methods such as coupled-cluster requires the computation of tensor contractions, the cost of which has polynomial computational scaling with respect to the system and basis set sizes. Each contraction may be executed via matrix multiplication on a properly ordered and structured tensor. However, data transpositions are often needed to reorder the tensors for each contraction. Writing and optimizing distributed-memory kernels for each transposition and contraction is tedious since the number of contractions scales combinatorially with the number of tensor indices. We present a distributed-memory numerical library (Cyclops Tensor Framework (CTF)) that automatically manages tensor blocking and redistribution to perform any user-specified contractions. CTF serves as the distributed-memory contraction engine in Aquarius, a new program designed for high-accuracy and massively-parallel quantum chemical computations. Aquarius implements a range of coupled-cluster and related methods such as CCSD and CCSDT by writing the equations on top of a C++ templated domain-specific language. This DSL calls CTF directly to manage the data and perform the contractions. Our CCSD and CCSDT implementations achieve high parallel scalability on the BlueGene/Q and Cray XC30 supercomputer architectures showing that accurate electronic structure calculations can be effectively carried out on top of general distributed-memory tensor primitives.},

  abstract = {A new formulation of the theory of nuclear reactions based on the properties of a generalized “optical” potential is presented. The real and imaginary part of this potential satisfy a dispersion type relation while its poles give rise to resonances in nuclear reactions. A new derivation of the Breit-Wigner formula is given in which the concept of channel radius is not employed. This derivation is extended to the case of overlapping resonances. These results can then be employed to obtain the complex potential well model for pure elastic scattering. This potential well is shown to become real as the average width of the resonances increases. Reactions as well as elastic scattering are treated. Considering the former process in an isolated resonance, we obtain a nonresonant term analogous to the familiar potential scattering term of elastic scattering. This is just the direct interaction term which thus appears automatically in this formalism. Upon performing the appropriate energy averages over resonances, the complex potential well model is generalized so as to include inelastic scattering. The effects of the identity of nucleons is investigated. It is shown that our formalism is valid as long as the exit channels can at most contain one nucleon.},

		Laguerre functions playing an important role in the L 2 expansion of continuum
		functions. The basis sets are tested with the hydrogen atom. The effectiveness
		of the basis is illustrated by the calculation of quantum defects associated

		the series below the ionisation limit as is finally demonstrated by an Edlen

Autoionization is forbidden for energetic reasons. The situation changes fundamentally in an inner-valence ionized cluster, which releases its excess energy by emitting an electron. This novel process, referred to as Intermolecular Coulombic Decay, is characterized by an efficient energy transfer between monomers in the cluster. The decay is ultrafast, taking place on a femtosecond time scale. Theoretical tools are developed to predict the properties, in particular lifetimes, of molecular systems undergoing electronic decay. These methods are applied to study the relaxation of inner-valence holes in clusters. In order to enable a treatment of the scattering and the many-particle problem with standard electronic correlation methods for bound states, a complex absorbing potential is added to the Hamiltonian. Conceptual as well as practical aspects of this procedure are discussed in detail. },

  abstract = {We present a Chebyshev-Davidson method to compute a few smallest positive eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of linear response eigenvalue problems. The method is applicable to more general linear response eigenvalue problems where some purely imaginary eigenvalues may exist. For the Chebyshev filter, a tight upper bound is obtained by a computable bound estimator that is provably correct under a reasonable condition. When the condition fails, the estimated upper bound may not be a true one. To overcome that, we develop an adaptive strategy for updating the estimated upper bound to guarantee the effectiveness of our new Chebyshev-Davidson method. We also obtain an estimate of the rate of convergence for the Ritz values by our algorithm. Finally, we present numerical results to demonstrate the performance of the proposed Chebyshev-Davidson method.},

  title       = {The Integral Screened Configuration Interaction Method},
  abstract    = {We present the formulation and implementation of the Integral-Screened Configuration-Interaction method (ISCI). The ISCI is a minimal-operational count integral-driven direct Configuration-Interaction (CI) method with a simple and rigorous integral screening (IS). With a novel derivation of the CI equations we show that the time consuming $\sigma$-vector calculation is separable up to an overall sign and that this separability can lead to a rigorous IS. The rigorous IS leads to linear scaling in the $\sigma$-vector step for large systems but can also lead to near linear scaling for smaller systems for the standard CISD, CISDT and CISDTQ methods, where the exponent for the scaling is 1.27, 1.48 and 1.98, respectively, even while retaining an accuracy of $10^{-14}$ or less in the energy. In the ISCI the non-relativistic CI problem can be broken into 42 generalized-matrix-vector products in the $\sigma$-vector calculation, which can be separately optimized. Due to the IS the ISCI can use dramatically larger orbital spaces combined with large CI expansions, on a single cpu, as compared with traditional CI methods. Further, it offers an intrinsic possibility for parallelization on modern computing architectures. We show examples of how IS leads to linear or near linear scaling with respect to the size of the simulation box in calculations on the Beryllium atom.},
