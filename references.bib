  abstract  = {This book describes the generalized Sturmian method, which offers a fresh approach to the calculation of atomic spectra. Generalized Sturmians are isoenergetic solutions to an approximate many-electron Schrödinger equation with a weighted potential. The weighting factors are chosen in such a way as to make all of the solutions correspond to a given energy. The advantage of such an isoenergetic basis set is that every basis function has the correct turning point behavior needed for efficient synthesis of the wave function. The book also discusses methods for automatic generation of symmetry-adapted basis sets. Calculations using the generalized Sturmian method are presented and compared with experimental results from the NIST database. The relationship of Sturmians to harmonic polynomials and hyperspherical harmonics is also described. Methods for treating angular functions and angular integrals by means of harmonic projection are discussed, and these methods are shown to be especially useful for relativistic calculations. A final chapter discusses application of the generalized Sturmian method to the calculation of molecular spectra.},

  abstract  = {In theoretical physics, theoretical chemistry and engineering, one often wishes to solve partial differential equations subject to a set of boundary conditions. This gives rise to eigenvalue problems of which some solutions may be very difficult to find. For example, the problem of finding eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for the Hamiltonian of a many-particle system is usually so difficult that it requires approximate methods, the most common of which is expansion of the eigenfunctions in terms of basis functions that obey the boundary conditions of the problem. The computational effort needed in such problems can be much reduced by making use of symmetry-adapted basis functions. The conventional method for generating symmetry-adapted basis sets is through the application of group theory, but this can be difficult. This book describes an easier method for generating symmetry-adapted basis sets automatically with computer techniques. The method has a wide range of applicability, and can be used to solve difficult eigenvalue problems in a number of fields. The book is of special interest to quantum theorists, computer scientists, computational chemists and applied mathematicians.},

Our scheme reaches a speedup of 2 orders of magnitude and has no significant loss of accuracy compared to an implementation of the full nonlocal single-determinant exchange operator. We find excellent agreement upon comparing Hartree–Fock eigenvalues, dipoles, and polarizabilities of selected molecules calculated using our method to values in the literature. To illustrate the efficiency of this scheme we perform calculations on systems with up to 240 carbon atoms.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, details of an implementation of a numerical code for computing the Kohn–Sham equations are presented and discussed. A fully self-consistent method of solving the quantum many-body problem within the context of density functional theory using a real-space method based on finite element discretisation of realspace is considered. Various numerical issues are explored such as (i) initial mesh motion aimed at co-aligning ions and vertices; (ii) a priori and a posteriori optimization of the mesh based on Kelly's error estimate; (iii) the influence of the quadrature rule and variation of the polynomial degree of interpolation in the finite element discretisation on the resulting total energy. Additionally, (iv) explicit, implicit and Gaussian approaches to treat the ionic potential are compared. A quadrupole expansion is employed to provide boundary conditions for the Poisson problem. To exemplify the soundness of our method, accurate computations are performed for hydrogen, helium, lithium, carbon, oxygen, neon, the hydrogen molecule ion and the carbon-monoxide molecule. Our methods, algorithms and implementation are shown to be stable with respect to convergence of the total energy in a parallel computational environment. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Convergence characteristics for various classes of HF problems are considered. Generally M1 has the faster rate of convergence but when no exchange is present ∼M2 is preferable becoming, in effect, inverse iteration with a difference correction. In all cases, except the hydrogenic one, the asymptotic rate of convergence of the SCF process is linear.},

  abstract  = {The newest version of the two-dimensional finite difference Hartree–Fock program for atoms and diatomic molecules is presented. This is an updated and extended version of the program published in this journal in 1996. It can be used to obtain reference, Hartree–Fock limit values of total energies and multipole moments for a wide range of diatomic molecules and their ions in order to calibrate existing and develop new basis sets, calculate (hyper)polarizabilities ( α z z , β z z z , γ z z z z , A z,zz , B z z , z z ) of atoms, homonuclear and heteronuclear diatomic molecules and their ions via the finite field method, perform DFT-type calculations using \{LDA\} or \{B88\} exchange functionals and \{LYP\} or \{VWN\} correlations ones or the self-consistent multiplicative constant method, perform one-particle calculations with (smooth) Coulomb and Krammers–Henneberger potentials and take account of finite nucleus models. The program is easy to install and compile (tarball+configure+make) and can be used to perform calculations within double- or quadruple-precision arithmetic.

Ireland Licensing provisions: \{GNU\} General Public License version 2 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 171196 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 9481802 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Fortran 77, C. Computer: any 32- or 64-bit platform. Operating system: Unix/Linux. RAM: Case dependent, from few \{MB\} to many \{GB\} Classification: 16.1. Catalogue identifier of previous version: ADEB_v1_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 98(1996)346 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: The program finds virtually exact solutions of the Hartree–Fock and density functional theory type equations for atoms, diatomic molecules and their ions. The lowest energy eigenstates of a given irreducible representation and spin can be obtained. The program can be used to perform one-particle calculations with (smooth) Coulomb and Krammers–Henneberger potentials and also DFT-type calculations using \{LDA\} or \{B88\} exchange functionals and \{LYP\} or \{VWN\} correlations ones or the self-consistent multiplicative constant method. Solution method: Single-particle two-dimensional numerical functions (orbitals) are used to construct an antisymmetric many-electron wave function of the restricted open-shell Hartree–Fock model. The orbitals are obtained by solving the Hartree–Fock equations as coupled two-dimensional second-order (elliptic) partial differential equations (PDEs). The Coulomb and exchange potentials are obtained as solutions of the corresponding Poisson equations. The \{PDEs\} are discretized by the eighth-order central difference stencil on a two-dimensional single grid, and the resulting large and sparse system of linear equations is solved by the (multicolour) successive overrelaxation ((MC)SOR) method. The self-consistent-field iterations are interwoven with the (MC)SOR ones and orbital energies and normalization factors are used to monitor the convergence. The accuracy of solutions depends mainly on the grid and the system under consideration, which means that within double precision arithmetic one can obtain orbitals and energies having up to 12 significant figures. If more accurate results are needed, quadruple-precision floating-point arithmetic can be used. Reasons for new version: Additional features, many modifications and corrections, improved convergence rate, overhauled code and documentation. Summary of revisions: see ChangeLog found in tar.gz archive Restrictions: The present version of the program is restricted to 60 orbitals. The maximum grid size is determined at compilation time. Unusual features: The program uses two C routines for allocating and deallocating memory. Several \{BLAS\} (Basic Linear Algebra System) routines are emulated by the program. When possible they should be replaced by their library equivalents. Additional comments: automake and autoconf tools are required to build and compile the program; checked with f77, gfortran and ifort compilers Running time: Very case dependent — from a few \{CPU\} seconds for the \{H2\} defined on a small grid up to several weeks for the Hartree–Fock-limit calculations for 40–50 electron molecules. },

  abstract  = {We review the application of the finite element (FE) method to ab initio electronic structure calculations in solids. The FE method is a general approach for the solution of differential and integral equations which uses a strictly local, piecewise-polynomial basis. Because the basis is composed of polynomials, the method is completely general and its accuracy is systematically improvable. Because the basis is strictly local in real space, the method allows for variable resolution in real space; produces sparse, structured matrices, enabling the effective use of iterative solution methods; and is well suited for parallel implementation. The method thus combines significant advantages of both real-space-grid and basis-oriented approaches, and so is well suited for large, accurate ab initio calculations. We review the construction and properties of the required FE bases and their use in the self-consistent solution of the Kohn–Sham equations of density functional theory.},

Exchange and correlation are treated with the local spin density or generalized gradient approximations. The basis functions and the electron density are projected on a real-space grid, in order to calculate the Hartree and exchange-correlation potentials and matrix elements, with a number of operations that scales linearly with the size of the system. We use a modified energy functional, whose minimization produces orthogonal wavefunctions and the same energy and density as the Kohn-Sham energy functional, without the need for an explicit orthogonalization. Additionally, using localized Wannier-like electron wavefunctions allows the computation time and memory required to minimize the energy to also scale linearly with the size of the system. Forces and stresses are also calculated efficiently and accurately, thus allowing structural relaxation and molecular dynamics simulations.},

It is shown that by taking Gaussian functions, and functions derived from these by differentiation with respect to the parameters, complete systems of functions can be constructed appropriate to any molecular problem, and that all the necessary integrals can be explicitly evaluated. These can be used in connexion with the molecular orbital method, or localized bond method, or the general method of treating linear combinations of many Slater determinants by the variational procedure. This general method of obtaining a sequence of solutions converging to the accurate solution is examined. It is shown that the only obstacle to the evaluation of wave functions of any required degree of accuracy is the labour of computation. A modification of the general method applicable to atoms is discussed and considered to be extremely practicable.},

To ensure easy of extensibility, PySCF uses the Python language to implement almost all its features, while computationally critical paths are implemented with heavily optimized C routines. Using this combined Python/C implementation, the package is as efficient as the best existing C or Fortran based quantum chemistry programs.

  abstract = {Electronic structure calculations have become an indispensable tool in many areas of materials science and quantum chemistry. Even though the Kohn–Sham formulation of the density-functional theory (DFT) simplifies the many-body problem significantly, one is still confronted with several numerical challenges. In this article we present the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method as implemented in the GPAW program package ( https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw [https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw] ) using a uniform real-space grid representation of the electronic wavefunctions. Compared to more traditional plane wave or localized basis set approaches, real-space grids offer several advantages, most notably good computational scalability and systematic convergence properties. However, as a unique feature GPAW also facilitates a localized atomic-orbital basis set in addition to the grid. The efficient atomic basis set is complementary to the more accurate grid, and the possibility to seamlessly switch between the two representations provides great flexibility. While DFT allows one to study ground state properties, time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) provides access to the excited states. We have implemented the two common formulations of TDDFT, namely the linear-response and the time propagation schemes. Electron transport calculations under finite-bias conditions can be performed with GPAW using non-equilibrium Green functions and the localized basis set. In addition to the basic features of the real-space PAW method, we also describe the implementation of selected exchange–correlation functionals, parallelization schemes, ΔSCF-method, x-ray absorption spectra, and maximally localized Wannier orbitals.},

  abstract = {Based on a generalization of the method of Sturmian expansions to the case of many-electron systems, a fundamentally new approach was developed for the construction of a complete set of intermediate states in many-body perturbation theory thereby avoiding integration over states of the continuous spectrum. A complete system of eigenfunctions of the generalized eigenvalue problem for the one-electron Hartree-Fock equation with a factor before the energy operator and fixed values of the Lagrange multipliers is used as a basis of single-particle virtual orbitals for an initial approximation to the eigenfunctions of the Hartree-Fock self-consistent field method. In the case of bound states, the spectrum of the effective operator is purely discrete, thus permitting one to completely eliminate integration over continuum virtual orbitals in applying methods of many-body perturbation theory to atomic and molecular calculations for a number of cases. As a consequence, one manages to avoid a number of the technical difficulties associated with inclusion of such states. The possibilities of the developed approach are illustrated in application to the investigation of the interaction of many-electron atoms with external fields.},

These stochastic methods are based on many-body wavefunctions and are capable of achieving very high accuracy. The algorithms are intrinsically parallel and well suited to implementation on petascale computers, and the computational cost scales as a polynomial in the number of particles. A guide to the systems and topics which have been investigated using these methods is given. The bulk of the article is devoted to an overview of the basic quantum Monte Carlo methods, the forms and optimization of wavefunctions, performing calculations under periodic boundary conditions, using pseudopotentials, excited-state calculations, sources of calculational inaccuracy, and calculating energy differences and forces.},

  abstract  = {Algorithms and working expressions for a grid-based fast multipole method (GB-FMM) have been developed and implemented. The computational domain is divided into cubic subdomains{,} organized in a hierarchical tree. The contribution to the electrostatic interaction energies from pairs of neighboring subdomains is computed using numerical integration{,} whereas the contributions from further apart subdomains are obtained using multipole expansions. The multipole moments of the subdomains are obtained by numerical integration. Linear scaling is achieved by translating and summing the multipoles according to the tree structure{,} such that each subdomain interacts with a number of subdomains that are almost independent of the size of the system. To compute electrostatic interaction energies of neighboring subdomains{,} we employ an algorithm which performs efficiently on general purpose graphics processing units (GPGPU). Calculations using one CPU for the FMM part and 20 GPGPUs consisting of tens of thousands of execution threads for the numerical integration algorithm show the scalability and parallel performance of the scheme. For calculations on systems consisting of Gaussian functions ([small alpha] = 1) distributed as fullerenes from C20 to C720{,} the total computation time and relative accuracy (ppb) are independent of the system size.},

In this paper we apply the method to core ionization in atoms and atomic ions, using a basis where                                                                           {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathsf{\{}V{\}}{\_}0({\{}{\backslash}bf x{\}}){\}}{\$}{\$}                 is chosen to be the nuclear attraction potential. We make use of a large-Z approximation, which leads to extremely simple closed-form expressions not only for energies, but also for values of the electronic potential at the nucleus. The method predicts approximately piecewise linear dependence of the core-ionization energies on the number of electrons N for isonuclear series, and an approximately linear dependence of $\Delta$E − Z                        2/2 on the nuclear charge Z for isoelectronic series.},

Es wird gezeigt, da{\ss} der Ansatz $\Psi$=$\psi$1 ($\chi$1) $\psi$2 ($\chi$1)... $\psi$N($\chi$N) (N=Anzahl der Elektronen) zu den Gleichungen der Hartreeschen Theorie des „selfconsistent field`` f{\"u}hrt.

Then, this new formulation is combined with the product of arbitrary GTO Cartesian angular parts, obtaining a finite expansion expressing this product as a multilinear combination of such functions sharing a common center. The combination of both results constitutes the General Gaussian Product Theorem (GGPT), a final compact expression for the product of an arbitrary number of Cartesian GTOs. The notation provides an easy way to express algebraically any general multicenter GTO product expression. It is also shown how by means of Nested Summation Symbols the computational implementation can be easily and elegantly achieved. Computational parallelizable schemes of the GGPT are provided.},

(i) They are sparse in the sense that only few data are needed for their representation. (ii) The matrix-vector multiplication is of almost linear complexity. (iii) In general, sums and products of these matrices are no longer in the same set, but their truncations to the                   {\$}{\backslash}Cal H{\$}                -matrix format are again of almost linear complexity.

  abstract = {In previous papers hierarchical matrices were introduced which are data-sparse and allow an approximate matrix arithmetic of nearly optimal complexity. In this paper we analyse the complexity (storage, addition, multiplication and inversion) of the hierarchical matrix arithmetics. Two criteria, the sparsity and idempotency, are sufficient to give the desired bounds. For standard finite element and boundary element applications we present a construction of the hierarchical matrix format for which we can give explicit bounds for the sparsity and idempotency.},
