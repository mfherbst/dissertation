  abstract  = {This book describes the generalized Sturmian method, which offers a fresh approach to the calculation of atomic spectra. Generalized Sturmians are isoenergetic solutions to an approximate many-electron Schrödinger equation with a weighted potential. The weighting factors are chosen in such a way as to make all of the solutions correspond to a given energy. The advantage of such an isoenergetic basis set is that every basis function has the correct turning point behavior needed for efficient synthesis of the wave function. The book also discusses methods for automatic generation of symmetry-adapted basis sets. Calculations using the generalized Sturmian method are presented and compared with experimental results from the NIST database. The relationship of Sturmians to harmonic polynomials and hyperspherical harmonics is also described. Methods for treating angular functions and angular integrals by means of harmonic projection are discussed, and these methods are shown to be especially useful for relativistic calculations. A final chapter discusses application of the generalized Sturmian method to the calculation of molecular spectra.},

  publisher = {World Scientific},

  author    = {John Scales Avery and Sten Rettrup and James Emil Avery},
  abstract  = {In theoretical physics, theoretical chemistry and engineering, one often wishes to solve partial differential equations subject to a set of boundary conditions. This gives rise to eigenvalue problems of which some solutions may be very difficult to find. For example, the problem of finding eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for the Hamiltonian of a many-particle system is usually so difficult that it requires approximate methods, the most common of which is expansion of the eigenfunctions in terms of basis functions that obey the boundary conditions of the problem. The computational effort needed in such problems can be much reduced by making use of symmetry-adapted basis functions. The conventional method for generating symmetry-adapted basis sets is through the application of group theory, but this can be difficult. This book describes an easier method for generating symmetry-adapted basis sets automatically with computer techniques. The method has a wide range of applicability, and can be used to solve difficult eigenvalue problems in a number of fields. The book is of special interest to quantum theorists, computer scientists, computational chemists and applied mathematicians.},

Various two- and three-point extrapolation schemes are tested and exponential functions are found to be superior compared to functions depending on the inverse power of the highest angular momentum function in the basis set. Total energies can be improved by roughly an order of magnitude, but atomization energies are only marginally improved by extrapolation.},

It is shown that by taking Gaussian functions, and functions derived from these by differentiation with respect to the parameters, complete systems of functions can be constructed appropriate to any molecular problem, and that all the necessary integrals can be explicitly evaluated. These can be used in connexion with the molecular orbital method, or localized bond method, or the general method of treating linear combinations of many Slater determinants by the variational procedure. This general method of obtaining a sequence of solutions converging to the accurate solution is examined. It is shown that the only obstacle to the evaluation of wave functions of any required degree of accuracy is the labour of computation. A modification of the general method applicable to atoms is discussed and considered to be extremely practicable.},

The package provides a wide range of tools to support simulations of finite size systems, extended systems with periodic boundary conditions, low dimensional periodic systems, and custom Hamiltonians, using mean-field and post-mean-field methods with standard Gaussian basis functions. To ensure easy of extensibility, PySCF uses the Python language to implement almost all its features, while computationally critical paths are implemented with heavily optimized C routines. Using this combined Python/C implementation, the package is as efficient as the best existing C or Fortran based quantum chemistry programs. In this paper we document the capabilities and design philosophy of the current version of the PySCF package.},

  abstract = {Based on a generalization of the method of Sturmian expansions to the case of many-electron systems, a fundamentally new approach was developed for the construction of a complete set of intermediate states in many-body perturbation theory thereby avoiding integration over states of the continuous spectrum. A complete system of eigenfunctions of the generalized eigenvalue problem for the one-electron Hartree-Fock equation with a factor before the energy operator and fixed values of the Lagrange multipliers is used as a basis of single-particle virtual orbitals for an initial approximation to the eigenfunctions of the Hartree-Fock self-consistent field method. In the case of bound states, the spectrum of the effective operator is purely discrete, thus permitting one to completely eliminate integration over continuum virtual orbitals in applying methods of many-body perturbation theory to atomic and molecular calculations for a number of cases. As a consequence, one manages to avoid a number of the technical difficulties associated with inclusion of such states. The possibilities of the developed approach are illustrated in application to the investigation of the interaction of many-electron atoms with external fields.},

These stochastic methods are based on many-body wavefunctions and are capable of achieving very high accuracy. The algorithms are intrinsically parallel and well suited to implementation on petascale computers, and the computational cost scales as a polynomial in the number of particles. A guide to the systems and topics which have been investigated using these methods is given. The bulk of the article is devoted to an overview of the basic quantum Monte Carlo methods, the forms and optimization of wavefunctions, performing calculations under periodic boundary conditions, using pseudopotentials, excited-state calculations, sources of calculational inaccuracy, and calculating energy differences and forces.},

In this paper we apply the method to core ionization in atoms and atomic ions, using a basis where                                                                           {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathsf{\{}V{\}}{\_}0({\{}{\backslash}bf x{\}}){\}}{\$}{\$}                 is chosen to be the nuclear attraction potential. We make use of a large-Z approximation, which leads to extremely simple closed-form expressions not only for energies, but also for values of the electronic potential at the nucleus. The method predicts approximately piecewise linear dependence of the core-ionization energies on the number of electrons N for isonuclear series, and an approximately linear dependence of $\Delta$E − Z                        2/2 on the nuclear charge Z for isoelectronic series.},

  abstract = {Das Variationsprinzip ∫$\delta${\textasciimacron}$\Psi$(L − E) $\Psi$d$\tau$=0 (L=Energieoperator) liefert, bekanntlich die Wellengleichung im Konfigurationsraum. Es wird gezeigt, da{\ss} der Ansatz $\Psi$=$\psi$1 ($\chi$1) $\psi$2 ($\chi$1)... $\psi$N($\chi$N) (N=Anzahl der Elektronen) zu den Gleichungen der Hartreeschen Theorie des „selfconsistent field`` f{\"u}hrt. Dieser Ansatz hat aber nicht die richtige Symmetrie. In dem wichtigen Spezialfall der „v{\"o}lligen Entartung des Termsystems`` kann aber $\Psi$ durch {\.{e}}in Produkt zweier Determinanten [Formel (50) des Textes] approximiert werden. Die entsprechende Rechnung wird durchgef{\"u}hrt. Die Gleichungen, die sich f{\"u}r $\psi$i($\chi$) ergeben, enthalten „Austauschglieder`` und k{\"o}nnen als Eulersche Gleichungen eines dreidimensionalen Variationsproblems mit der Energie als Wirkungsintegral [Formel (93)] aufgefa{\ss}t werden. Die Gleichungen sind nicht wesentlich komplizierter als die von Hartree, d{\"u}rften aber viel genauere Resultate ergeben. Zum Schlu{\ss} wird eine Formel f{\"u}r die Intensit{\"a}ten angegeben, die- Glieder enth{\"a}lt, welche einer „Umgruppierung`` der inneren Elektronen bei einem Quantensprung entsprechen.},
