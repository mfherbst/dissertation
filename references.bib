  abstract  = {A numerical algorithm is proposed for computing an extreme eigenpair of a symmetric/positive-definite matrix pencil ( A , B ) . The leftmost or the rightmost eigenvalue can be targeted. Knowledge of ( A , B ) is only required through a routine that performs matrix–vector products. The method has excellent global convergence properties and its local rate of convergence is superlinear. It is based on a constrained truncated-CG trust-region strategy to optimize the Rayleigh quotient, in the framework of a recently proposed trust-region scheme on Riemannian manifolds. },

  abstract  = {This book describes the generalized Sturmian method, which offers a fresh approach to the calculation of atomic spectra. Generalized Sturmians are isoenergetic solutions to an approximate many-electron Schrödinger equation with a weighted potential. The weighting factors are chosen in such a way as to make all of the solutions correspond to a given energy. The advantage of such an isoenergetic basis set is that every basis function has the correct turning point behavior needed for efficient synthesis of the wave function. The book also discusses methods for automatic generation of symmetry-adapted basis sets. Calculations using the generalized Sturmian method are presented and compared with experimental results from the NIST database. The relationship of Sturmians to harmonic polynomials and hyperspherical harmonics is also described. Methods for treating angular functions and angular integrals by means of harmonic projection are discussed, and these methods are shown to be especially useful for relativistic calculations. A final chapter discusses application of the generalized Sturmian method to the calculation of molecular spectra.},

V2B is constructed by fitting 40,000 dimer energies calculated at the CCSD(T)/CBS level of theory and imposing the correct asymptotic behavior at long-range as predicted from “first principles”. The comparison of the calculated vibration–rotation tunneling (VRT) spectrum and second virial coefficient with the corresponding experimental results demonstrates the accuracy of the MB-pol dimer potential energy surface.},

  abstract      = {Recent advances in our understanding of tree-level QCD amplitudes in the massless limit exploiting an effective (maximal) supersymmetry have led to the complete analytic construction of tree-amplitudes with up to four external quark-anti-quark pairs. In this work we compare the numerical efficiency of evaluating these closed analytic formulae to a numerically efficient implementation of the Berends-Giele recursion. We compare calculation times for tree-amplitudes with parton numbers ranging from 4 to 25 with no, one, two and three external quark lines. We find that the exact results are generally faster in the case of MHV and NMHV amplitudes. Starting with the NNMHV amplitudes the Berends-Giele recursion becomes more efficient. In addition to the runtime we also compared the numerical accuracy. The analytic formulae are on average more accurate than the off-shell recursion relations though both are well suited for complicated phenomenological applications. In both cases we observe a reduction in the average accuracy when phase space configurations close to singular regions are evaluated. We believe that the above findings provide valuable information to select the right method for phenomenological applications.},

Our scheme reaches a speedup of 2 orders of magnitude and has no significant loss of accuracy compared to an implementation of the full nonlocal single-determinant exchange operator. We find excellent agreement upon comparing Hartree–Fock eigenvalues, dipoles, and polarizabilities of selected molecules calculated using our method to values in the literature. To illustrate the efficiency of this scheme we perform calculations on systems with up to 240 carbon atoms. },

These methods, which rely on the short-ranged nature of electronic structure, will allow accurate, ab initio simulations of systems of unprecedented size. The theory behind the locality of electronic structure is described and related to physical properties of systems to be modelled, along with a survey of recent developments in real-space methods which are important for efficient use of high-performance computers. The linear-scaling methods proposed to date can be divided into seven different areas, and the applicability, efficiency and advantages of the methods proposed in these areas are then discussed. The applications of linear-scaling methods, as well as the implementations available as computer programs, are considered. Finally, the prospects for and the challenges facing linear-scaling methods are discussed.},

The computational method used to perform such three dimensional finite element Hartree–Fock calculations is based on the use of a factorized Green’s function for both the solution of the three dimensional Schrödinger-type equations as well as of the Poisson equation. Results of such calculations are reported for the helium atom, the beryllium atom, and the three molecules methane, water and ammonia and are compared with highly accurate literature values for the atoms and the results of Gaussian basis set calculations performed with \{NWCHEM\} for the molecules. },

In this paper we use epidemiological models to explain user adoption and abandonment of OSNs, where adoption is analogous to infection and abandonment is analogous to recovery. We modify the traditional SIR model of disease spread by incorporating infectious recovery dynamics such that contact between a recovered and infected member of the population is required for recovery. The proposed infectious recovery SIR model (irSIR model) is validated using publicly available Google search query data for "MySpace" as a case study of an OSN that has exhibited both adoption and abandonment phases. The irSIR model is then applied to search query data for "Facebook," which is just beginning to show the onset of an abandonment phase. Extrapolating the best fit model into the future predicts a rapid decline in Facebook activity in the next few years.},

A hierarchy of coupled cluster models, CCS, CC2, CCSD, CC3, \{CCSDT\} etc., is presented where \{CC2\} and \{CC3\} are approximate coupled cluster models defined by similar approximations. Higher levels give increased accuracy at increased computational effort. The scaling of CCS, CC2, CCSD, \{CC3\} and \{CCSDT\} is N4, N5, N6, \{N7\} and N8, respectively where N is th the number of orbitals.

A fully self-consistent method of solving the quantum many-body problem within the context of density functional theory using a real-space method based on finite element discretisation of realspace is considered. Various numerical issues are explored such as (i) initial mesh motion aimed at co-aligning ions and vertices; (ii) a priori and a posteriori optimization of the mesh based on Kelly's error estimate; (iii) the influence of the quadrature rule and variation of the polynomial degree of interpolation in the finite element discretisation on the resulting total energy. Additionally, (iv) explicit, implicit and Gaussian approaches to treat the ionic potential are compared. A quadrupole expansion is employed to provide boundary conditions for the Poisson problem. To exemplify the soundness of our method, accurate computations are performed for hydrogen, helium, lithium, carbon, oxygen, neon, the hydrogen molecule ion and the carbon-monoxide molecule. Our methods, algorithms and implementation are shown to be stable with respect to convergence of the total energy in a parallel computational environment. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = { It is well-known that time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) yields substantial errors for the excitation energies of charge-transfer (CT) excited states, when approximate standard exchange-correlation (xc) functionals are used, for example, SVWN, BLYP, or B3LYP. Also, the correct 1/R asymptotic behavior of CT states with respect to a distance coordinate R between the separated charges of the CT state is not reproduced by TDDFT employing these xc-functionals. Here, we demonstrate by analysis of the TDDFT equations that the first failure is due to the self-interaction error in the orbital energies from the ground-state DFT calculation, while the latter is a similar self-interaction error in TDDFT arising through the electron transfer in the CT state. Possible correction schemes, such as inclusion of exact Hartree−Fock or exact Kohn−Sham exchange, as well as aspects of the exact xc-functional are discussed in this context. Furthermore, a practical approach is proposed which combines the benefits of TDDFT and configuration interaction singles (CIS) and which does not suffer from electron-transfer self-interaction. The latter approach is applied to a (1,4)-phenylene-linked zincbacteriochlorin−bacteriochlorin complex and to a bacteriochlorophyll−spheroidene complex, in which CT states may play important roles in energy and electron-transfer processes. The errors of TDDFT alone for the CT states are demonstrated, and reasonable estimates for the true excitation energies of these states are given. },

  abstract  = {The algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC) scheme for the polarization propagator provides a series of ab initio methods for the calculation of excited states based on perturbation theory. In recent years, the second-order ADC(2) scheme has attracted attention in the computational chemistry community because of its reliable accuracy and reasonable computational effort in the calculation of predominantly singly excited states. Owing to their size-consistency, ADC methods are suited for the investigation of large molecules. In addition, their Hermitian structure and the availability of the intermediate state representation (ISR) allow for straightforward computation of excited-state properties. Recently, an efficient implementation of ADC(3) has been reported, and its high accuracy for typical valence excited states of organic chromophores has been demonstrated. In this review, the origin of ADC-based excited-state methods in propagator theory is described, and an intuitive route for the derivation of algebraic expressions via the ISR is outlined and comparison to other excited-state methods is made. Existing computer codes and implemented ADC variants are reviewed, but most importantly the accuracy and limits of different ADC schemes are critically examined.Conflict of interest: The authors have declared no conflicts of interest for this article.For further resources related to this article, please visit the WIREs website.},

  abstract  = { The generalized Koopmans’ theorem (EKT) yields an estimate of ionization potentials (IPs) of an N-electron system. This estimate (IPEKT) is obtained as an eigenvalue of a generalized eigenvalue problem. Katriel and Davidson provided a proof [ Katriel, J.; Davidson, E. R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. , 1980, 77, 1403. ] that the EKT predicts the exact lowest IP for ground states of Coulomb systems. However, subsequently, several articles have been published challenging the exactness of the EKT and providing disproofs. This apparent contradiction is resolved by demonstrating that the lowest eigenvalue of the generalized Koopmans’ procedure does, in general, not exist. This explains why contradictory results are obtained about the lowest IPEKT since its existence has implicitly been assumed. Nonetheless, it will also be shown here that the generalized Koopmans’ approach gives IPs that are arbitrarily close to the exact lowest ionization energy. The eigenvalues obtained according to the EKT have an accumulation point given by the exact lowest IP. },

After outlining a class of MCHF problems, the derivation of the MCHF equations is reviewed and some theory developed on the variation of the energy functional with respect to a rotation of the orbital basis among orbitals of the same symmetry. Various procedures are proposed and evaluated for dealing with cases where the radial basis for a given total energy is not unique.

  abstract  = {Abstract The Eastern Warburton Basin, Northeast South Australia, features major geophysical anomalies, including a magnetic high of near-200&#xa0;nT centred on a ~&#xa0;25&#xa0;km-wide magnetic low (&lt;&#xa0;100&#xa0;nT), interpreted in terms of a magmatic body below 6&#xa0;km depth. A distinct seismic tomographic low velocity anomaly may reflect its thick (9.5&#xa0;km) sedimentary section, high temperatures and possible deep fracturing. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analyses of granites resolves microbreccia veins consisting of micron-scale particles injected into resorbed quartz grains. Planar and sub-planar elements in quartz grains (Qz/PE) occur in granites, volcanics and sediments of the &gt;&#xa0;30,000&#xa0;km-large Eastern Warburton Basin. The Qz/PE include multiple intersecting planar to curved sub-planar elements with relic lamellae less than 2&#xa0;μm wide with spacing of 4–5&#xa0;μm. Qz/PE are commonly re-deformed, displaying bent and wavy patterns accompanied with fluid inclusions. U-stage measurements of a total of 243 planar sets in 157 quartz grains indicate dominance of ∏{10–12}, ω{10–13} and subsidiary §{11–22}, {22–41}, m{10–11} and x{51–61} planes. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis displays relic narrow ≤&#xa0;1&#xa0;μm-wide lamellae and relic non-sub grain boundaries where crystal segments maintain optical continuity. Extensive sericite alteration of feldspar suggests hydrothermal alteration to a depth of ~&#xa0;500&#xa0;m below the unconformity which overlies the Qz/PE-bearing Warburton Basin terrain. The data are discussed in terms of (A) Tectonic–metamorphic deformation and (B) impact shock metamorphism producing planar deformation features (Qz/PDF). Deformed Qz/PE are compared to re-deformed Qz/PDFs in the Sudbury, Vredefort, Manicouagan and Charlevoix impact structures. A 4–5&#xa0;km uplift of the Big Lake Granite Suite during ~&#xa0;298–295&#xa0;Ma is consistent with missing of upper Ordovician to Devonian strata and possible impact rebound. The occurrence of circular seismic tomography anomalies below the east Warburton Basin, the Poolowana Basin and the Woodleigh impact structure signifies a potential diagnostic nature of circular tomographic anomalies.},

For both energies, solid improvements are obtained with each increment in X. The basis-set errors for the total energy (ΔE) fit an exponential form better than a power form, and the total energy is better fitted than the binding energy. It is difficult to find generally reliable extrapolation schemes for the total energy. In most cases, the most successful scheme gives results extrapolated beyond a given X that are comparable to the cc-pV(X+1)Z results, but occasionally it fails dramatically for large X. Indeed, explicit calculation of the energy in a larger basis set, especially the cc-pV6Z set for which ΔE⩽0.1 mEh, gives the most reliable estimate of the basis-set limit. },

  abstract       = {This dissertation unifies one of the central methods of classical rate calculation, `Transition-State Theory' (TST), with quantum mechanics, thereby deriving a rigorous `Quantum Transition-State Theory' (QTST). The resulting QTST is identical to ring polymer molecular dynamics transition-state theory (RPMD-TST), which was previously considered a heuristic method, and whose results we thereby validate. The key step in deriving a QTST is alignment of the flux and side dividing surfaces in path-integral space to obtain a quantum flux-side time-correlation function with a non-zero $t\to 0_+$ limit. We then prove that this produces the exact quantum rate in the absence of recrossing by the exact quantum dynamics, fulfilling the requirements of a QTST. Furthermore, strong evidence is presented that this is the only QTST with positive-definite Boltzmann statistics and therefore the pre-eminent method for computation of thermal quantum rates in direct reactions.},

The spin factor (-1)^2s belongs to the exchange wave function when this function is constructed so as to get the spinor ambiguity under control. This is achieved by effecting the exchange of the azimuthal angle by means of rotations and admitting only rotations in one sense. The procedure works in Galilean as well as in Lorentz-invariant quantum mechanics. Relativistic quantum field theory is not required.},

This is an updated and extended version of the program published in this journal in 1996. It can be used to obtain reference, Hartree–Fock limit values of total energies and multipole moments for a wide range of diatomic molecules and their ions in order to calibrate existing and develop new basis sets, calculate (hyper)polarizabilities ( α z z , β z z z , γ z z z z , A z,zz , B z z , z z ) of atoms, homonuclear and heteronuclear diatomic molecules and their ions via the finite field method, perform DFT-type calculations using \{LDA\} or \{B88\} exchange functionals and \{LYP\} or \{VWN\} correlations ones or the self-consistent multiplicative constant method, perform one-particle calculations with (smooth) Coulomb and Krammers–Henneberger potentials and take account of finite nucleus models. The program is easy to install and compile (tarball+configure+make) and can be used to perform calculations within double- or quadruple-precision arithmetic.

The program can be used to perform one-particle calculations with (smooth) Coulomb and Krammers–Henneberger potentials and also DFT-type calculations using \{LDA\} or \{B88\} exchange functionals and \{LYP\} or \{VWN\} correlations ones or the self-consistent multiplicative constant method. Solution method: Single-particle two-dimensional numerical functions (orbitals) are used to construct an antisymmetric many-electron wave function of the restricted open-shell Hartree–Fock model. The orbitals are obtained by solving the Hartree–Fock equations as coupled two-dimensional second-order (elliptic) partial differential equations (PDEs). The Coulomb and exchange potentials are obtained as solutions of the corresponding Poisson equations. The \{PDEs\} are discretized by the eighth-order central difference stencil on a two-dimensional single grid, and the resulting large and sparse system of linear equations is solved by the (multicolour) successive overrelaxation ((MC)SOR) method. The self-consistent-field iterations are interwoven with the (MC)SOR ones and orbital energies and normalization factors are used to monitor the convergence. The accuracy of solutions depends mainly on the grid and the system under consideration, which means that within double precision arithmetic one can obtain orbitals and energies having up to 12 significant figures. If more accurate results are needed, quadruple-precision floating-point arithmetic can be used. Reasons for new version: Additional features, many modifications and corrections, improved convergence rate, overhauled code and documentation. Summary of revisions: see ChangeLog found in tar.gz archive Restrictions: The present version of the program is restricted to 60 orbitals. The maximum grid size is determined at compilation time. Unusual features: The program uses two C routines for allocating and deallocating memory. Several \{BLAS\} (Basic Linear Algebra System) routines are emulated by the program. When possible they should be replaced by their library equivalents. Additional comments: automake and autoconf tools are required to build and compile the program; checked with f77, gfortran and ifort compilers Running time: Very case dependent — from a few \{CPU\} seconds for the \{H2\} defined on a small grid up to several weeks for the Hartree–Fock-limit calculations for 40–50 electron molecules. },

  abstract  = {Over the last decades, linear-scaling quantum–chemical methods (QM) have become an important tool for studying large molecular systems, so that already with modest computer resources molecules with more than a thousand atoms are well in reach. The key feature of the methods is the reduction of the steep scaling of the computational effort of conventional ab initio schemes to linear while reliability and accuracy of the underlying quantum–chemical approximation is preserved in the most successful schemes. This review gives a brief overview of selected linear-scaling approaches at the Hartree–Fock and density-functional theory level with a particular emphasis on density matrix-based approaches. The focus is not only on energetics, but also on the calculation of molecular properties providing an important link between theory and experiment. In addition, the usefulness of linear-scaling QM approaches within quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) hybrid schemes is briefly discussed. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {An efficient new molecular orbital (MO) basis algorithm is reported implementing the pair atomic resolution of the identity approximation (PARI) to evaluate the exact exchange contribution (K) to self-consistent field methods, such as hybrid and range-separated hybrid density functionals. The PARI approximation, in which atomic orbital (AO) basis function pairs are expanded using auxiliary basis functions centered only on their two respective atoms, was recently investigated by Merlot et al. [J. Comput. Chem. 2013, 34, 1486]. Our algorithm is significantly faster than quartic scaling RI-K, with an asymptotic exchange speedup for hybrid functionals of (1 + X/N), where N and X are the AO and auxiliary basis dimensions. The asymptotic speedup is 2 + 2X/N for range separated hybrids such as CAM-B3LYP, ωB97X-D, and ωB97X-V which include short- and long-range exact exchange. The observed speedup for exchange in ωB97X-V for a C68 graphene fragment in the cc-pVTZ basis is 3.4 relative to RI-K. Like conventional RI-K, our method greatly outperforms conventional integral evaluation in large basis sets; a speedup of 19 is obtained in the cc-pVQZ basis on a C54 graphene fragment. Negligible loss of accuracy relative to exact integral evaluation is demonstrated on databases of bonded and nonbonded interactions. We also demonstrate both analytically and numerically that the PARI-K approximation is variationally stable.},

  abstract  = {Outflow channels on Mars are interpreted as the product of gigantic floods due to the catastrophic eruption of groundwater that may also have initiated episodes of climate change. Marte Vallis, the largest of the young martian outflow channels (<500 Ma), is embayed by lava flows that hinder detailed studies and comparisons with older channel systems. Understanding Marte Vallis is essential to our assessment of recent Mars hydrologic activity during a period otherwise considered to be cold and dry. Using the SHARAD sounding radar, we present a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of buried channels on Mars and provide estimates of paleo-hydrologic parameters. Our work shows that Cerberus Fossae provided the waters that carved Marte Vallis, and extended an additional 180 kilometers to the east prior to the emplacement of the younger lava flows. We identify two stages of channel incision and determine that channel depths were more than twice that of previous estimates.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, the possibility is explored to speed up Hartree–Fock and hybrid density functional calculations by forming the Coulomb and exchange parts of the Fock matrix by different approximations. For the Coulomb part the previously introduced Split-RI-J variant (F. Neese, J. Comput. Chem. 24 (2003) 1740) of the well-known ‘density fitting’ approximation is used. The exchange part is formed by semi-numerical integration techniques that are closely related to Friesner’s pioneering pseudo-spectral approach. Our potentially linear scaling realization of this algorithm is called the ‘chain-of-spheres exchange’ (COSX). A combination of semi-numerical integration and density fitting is also proposed. Both Split-RI-J and \{COSX\} scale very well with the highest angular momentum in the basis sets. It is shown that for extended basis sets speed-ups of up to two orders of magnitude compared to traditional implementations can be obtained in this way. Total energies are reproduced with an average error of &lt;0.3&#xa0;kcal/mol as determined from extended test calculations with various basis sets on a set of 26 molecules with 20–200 atoms and up to 2000 basis functions. Reaction energies agree to within 0.2&#xa0;kcal/mol (Hartree–Fock) or 0.05&#xa0;kcal/mol (hybrid DFT) with the canonical values. The \{COSX\} algorithm parallelizes with a speedup of 8.6 observed for 10 processes. Minimum energy geometries differ by less than 0.3&#xa0;pm in the bond distances and 0.5° in the bond angels from their canonical values. These developments enable highly efficient and accurate self-consistent field calculations including nonlocal Hartree–Fock exchange for large molecules. In combination with the RI-MP2 method and large basis sets, second-order many body perturbation energies can be obtained for medium sized molecules with unprecedented efficiency. The algorithms are implemented into the \{ORCA\} electronic structure system. },

The gas expelled by the supernova explosion is launched with velocities ∼1000 kilometers per second into the ambient, tenuous interstellar medium, producing shocks that excite hydrogen lines. We have used an optical integral-field spectrograph to obtain high-resolution spatial-spectral maps that allow us to study in detail the shocks in the northwestern rim of supernova 1006. The two-component Hα line is detected at 133 sky locations. Variations in the broad line widths and the broad-to-narrow line intensity ratios across tens of atomic mean free paths suggest the presence of suprathermal protons, the potential seed particles for generating high-energy cosmic-rays.},

  abstract      = {The ultimate fates of binary companions to stars (including whether the companion survives and the final orbit of the binary) are of interest in light of an increasing number of recently discovered, low-mass companions to white dwarfs (WDs). In this Letter, we study the evolution of a two-body system wherein the orbit adjusts due to structural changes in the primary, dissipation of orbital energy via tides, and mass loss during the giant phases; previous studies have not incorporated changes in the primary's spin. For companions ranging from Jupiter's mass to ~0.3 Msun and primaries ranging from 1--3 Msun, we determine the minimum initial semimajor axis required for the companion to avoid engulfment by the primary during post-main-sequence evolution, and highlight the implications for the ultimate survival of the known exoplanets. We present regions in secondary mass and orbital period space where an engulfed companion might be expected to survive the common envelope phase (CEP), and compare with known M dwarf+WD short-period binaries. Finally, we note that engulfed Earth-like planets cannot survive a CEP. Detection of a first-generation terrestrial planet in the white dwarf habitable zone requires scattering from a several-AU orbit to a high-eccentricity orbit (with a periastron of ~Rsun) from which it is damped into a circular orbit via tidal friction, possibly rendering it an uninhabitable, charred ember.},

  abstract  = {We review the application of the finite element (FE) method to ab initio electronic structure calculations in solids. The FE method is a general approach for the solution of differential and integral equations which uses a strictly local, piecewise-polynomial basis. Because the basis is composed of polynomials, the method is completely general and its accuracy is systematically improvable. Because the basis is strictly local in real space, the method allows for variable resolution in real space; produces sparse, structured matrices, enabling the effective use of iterative solution methods; and is well suited for parallel implementation. The method thus combines significant advantages of both real-space-grid and basis-oriented approaches, and so is well suited for large, accurate ab initio calculations. We review the construction and properties of the required FE bases and their use in the self-consistent solution of the Kohn–Sham equations of density functional theory.},

  Abstract                 = {The molecules in liquid water move about constantly, but on average they cling to each other through hydrogen bonds, like dancers who keep switching partners. Richardson et al. uncovered a fresh twist in this molecular dance (see the Perspective by Clary). Studying clusters of six molecules each{\textemdash}essentially the smallest three-dimensional water droplets{\textemdash}they observed coupled motion of two different molecules in the cluster. The process breaks two different hydrogen bonds concurrently in a pattern akin to rotating gears.Science, this issue p. 1310; see also p. 1267The nature of the intermolecular forces between water molecules is the same in small hydrogen-bonded clusters as in the bulk. The rotational spectra of the clusters therefore give insight into the intermolecular forces present in liquid water and ice. The water hexamer is the smallest water cluster to support low-energy structures with branched three-dimensional hydrogen-bond networks, rather than cyclic two-dimensional topologies. Here we report measurements of splitting patterns in rotational transitions of the water hexamer prism, and we used quantum simulations to show that they result from geared and antigeared rotations of a pair of water molecules. Unlike previously reported tunneling motions in water clusters, the geared motion involves the concerted breaking of two hydrogen bonds. Similar types of motion may be feasible in interfacial and confined water.},

  abstract  = {We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate neural processes when music gains reward value the first time it is heard. The degree of activity in the mesolimbic striatal regions, especially the nucleus accumbens, during music listening was the best predictor of the amount listeners were willing to spend on previously unheard music in an auction paradigm. Importantly, the auditory cortices, amygdala, and ventromedial prefrontal regions showed increased activity during listening conditions requiring valuation, but did not predict reward value, which was instead predicted by increasing functional connectivity of these regions with the nucleus accumbens as the reward value increased. Thus, aesthetic rewards arise from the interaction between mesolimbic reward circuitry and cortical networks involved in perceptual analysis and valuation.},

Exchange and correlation are treated with the local spin density or generalized gradient approximations. The basis functions and the electron density are projected on a real-space grid, in order to calculate the Hartree and exchange-correlation potentials and matrix elements, with a number of operations that scales linearly with the size of the system. We use a modified energy functional, whose minimization produces orthogonal wavefunctions and the same energy and density as the Kohn-Sham energy functional, without the need for an explicit orthogonalization. Additionally, using localized Wannier-like electron wavefunctions allows the computation time and memory required to minimize the energy to also scale linearly with the size of the system. Forces and stresses are also calculated efficiently and accurately, thus allowing structural relaxation and molecular dynamics simulations.},

  abstract      = {We present enhancements to the computational e?ciency of exact exchange calculations using the density matrix and local support functions. We introduce a numerical method which avoids the explicit calculation the four-center two-electron repulsion integrals and reduces the prefactor scaling by a factor N, where N is the number of atoms within the range of the exact exchange Hamiltonian. This approach is based on a contraction-reduction scheme, and takes advantage of the discretization space which enables the direct summation over the support functions in a localized space. Using the sparsity property of the density matrix, the scaling of the prefactor can be further reduced to reach asymptotically O(N).},

Calculations on 1-d, 2-d and 3-d carbon systems with the 3–21G basis establish crossover points versus the conventional approach, and yield linear scaling coefficients between 106 and 108 floating point operation, depending on dimensionalit. The \{CFMM\} plus J engine is a dramatic improvement for molecules over 50 to 100 atoms. },

The \{CFMM\} calculates Coulomb interactions between charge distributions, represented by continuous functions, in work scaling linearly with their number for constant density systems. Model calculations suggest that for errors in the potential of 10−10, the \{CFMM\} becomes faster than direct evaluation for less than 10000 Gaussian charge distributions. Using the \{CFMM\} to form the J matrix in ab initio density functional and Hartree-Fock calculations shows that a two-three times speedup is attainable for the linear alkanes C10H22-C20H42. },

After its entrance to the atmosphere and after travel by several hun- dred of kilometers the body exploded in a powerful event responsible for physical damages and injured people spread over a region enclosing several large cities. We present in this letter the results of a preliminary reconstruction of the orbit of the Chelyabinsk meteoroid. Using evidence gathered by one camera at the Revolution Square in the city of Chelyabinsk and other videos recorded by witnesses in the close city of Korkino, we calculate the trajectory of the body in the atmosphere and use it to reconstruct the orbit in space of the meteoroid previous to the violent encounter with our planet. In order to account for the uncertainties implicit in the determination of the trajectory of the body in the atmosphere, we use Monte Carlo methods to calculate the most probable orbital parameters. We use this result to classify the meteoroid among the near Earth asteroid families finding that the parent body belonged to the Apollo asteroids. Although semimajor axis and inclination of the preliminary orbit computed by us are uncertain, the rest of orbital elements are well constrained in this preliminary reconstruction.},

The set of feasible points determines a differentiable manifold introduced by Stiefel in 1935. Based on the nice geometric structure, the optimality conditions are obtained by the global Lagrange multiplier rule, and global optimality conditions based on local information, which make the advantages of using the Riemannian geometry in difficult smooth optimization problems clear.},

It is shown that by taking Gaussian functions, and functions derived from these by differentiation with respect to the parameters, complete systems of functions can be constructed appropriate to any molecular problem, and that all the necessary integrals can be explicitly evaluated. These can be used in connexion with the molecular orbital method, or localized bond method, or the general method of treating linear combinations of many Slater determinants by the variational procedure. This general method of obtaining a sequence of solutions converging to the accurate solution is examined. It is shown that the only obstacle to the evaluation of wave functions of any required degree of accuracy is the labour of computation. A modification of the general method applicable to atoms is discussed and considered to be extremely practicable.},

The package provides a wide range of tools to support simulations of finite size systems, extended systems with periodic boundary conditions, low dimensional periodic systems, and custom Hamiltonians, using mean-field and post-mean-field methods with standard Gaussian basis functions. To ensure easy of extensibility, PySCF uses the Python language to implement almost all its features, while computationally critical paths are implemented with heavily optimized C routines. Using this combined Python/C implementation, the package is as efficient as the best existing C or Fortran based quantum chemistry programs. In this paper we document the capabilities and design philosophy of the current version of the PySCF package.},

  abstract = {Electronic structure calculations have become an indispensable tool in many areas of materials science and quantum chemistry. Even though the Kohn–Sham formulation of the density-functional theory (DFT) simplifies the many-body problem significantly, one is still confronted with several numerical challenges. In this article we present the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method as implemented in the GPAW program package ( https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw [https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw] ) using a uniform real-space grid representation of the electronic wavefunctions. Compared to more traditional plane wave or localized basis set approaches, real-space grids offer several advantages, most notably good computational scalability and systematic convergence properties. However, as a unique feature GPAW also facilitates a localized atomic-orbital basis set in addition to the grid. The efficient atomic basis set is complementary to the more accurate grid, and the possibility to seamlessly switch between the two representations provides great flexibility. While DFT allows one to study ground state properties, time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) provides access to the excited states. We have implemented the two common formulations of TDDFT, namely the linear-response and the time propagation schemes. Electron transport calculations under finite-bias conditions can be performed with GPAW using non-equilibrium Green functions and the localized basis set. In addition to the basic features of the real-space PAW method, we also describe the implementation of selected exchange–correlation functionals, parallelization schemes, ΔSCF-method, x-ray absorption spectra, and maximally localized Wannier orbitals.},

They were calculated in an algebraic approach using Slater-type atomic orbitals (AOs) as basis functions. Nonlinear parameters (orbital exponents) of AOs were optimized with exceptional accuracy by second-order methods. As a result, it was possible to satisfy exactly the virial relation (10--14--10--17) with calculated atomic term energies being close to the Hartree--Fock limit.},

  abstract = {The unrestricted Hartree-Fock method is important for discussing several effects, including the spin density produced in the core of an atom by exchange with an unfilled valence electron shell. The method allows electrons with$\alpha$ and$\beta$ spins to have slightly different orbitals due to the differing exchange interaction, but ignores the fact that this automatically results in gaining also some in-out correlation energy. The validity of the method must therefore be questioned, since correlation is in general the larger effect. It is shown that in atomic calculations the method gives results which are in fact correct to a good order of approximation. However, the interplay of spin polarisation and correlation is such that in some molecular or other systems the method would fail.},

  abstract = {Based on a generalization of the method of Sturmian expansions to the case of many-electron systems, a fundamentally new approach was developed for the construction of a complete set of intermediate states in many-body perturbation theory thereby avoiding integration over states of the continuous spectrum. A complete system of eigenfunctions of the generalized eigenvalue problem for the one-electron Hartree-Fock equation with a factor before the energy operator and fixed values of the Lagrange multipliers is used as a basis of single-particle virtual orbitals for an initial approximation to the eigenfunctions of the Hartree-Fock self-consistent field method. In the case of bound states, the spectrum of the effective operator is purely discrete, thus permitting one to completely eliminate integration over continuum virtual orbitals in applying methods of many-body perturbation theory to atomic and molecular calculations for a number of cases. As a consequence, one manages to avoid a number of the technical difficulties associated with inclusion of such states. The possibilities of the developed approach are illustrated in application to the investigation of the interaction of many-electron atoms with external fields.},
