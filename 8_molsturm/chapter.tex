In chapter \vref{ch:NumSolveHF}
hinted at general structure of \SCF algorithms,
in previous chapter \ref{ch:LazyMatrices}
presented lazy matrix formalism to code such algorithms at high level.
\molsturm picks up on both these ideas to achieve
a highly modular and flexible quantum-chemistry package,
which aids the investigation of novel basis functions.

different basis function types
With our \molsturm package we want to support such research directions
by providing a program package
which offers a common platform for developing, testing and analysing
quantum-chemical methods irrespective of the basis function type employed for
the discretisation.

Considering the flexibility which results from such approaches,
they are a perfect ingredient for
a quantum-chemical method development framework
supporting the numerical requirements of various types of basis functions.
Such a framework has been missing up to today to the best of our knowledge.

This paper presents our new \molsturm quantum-chemistry framework.
We do not only implement our \contraction-based SCF scheme
in such a way that the code is fully agnostic to the type of basis function used,
but we furthermore provide a powerful \python interface.
By means of the latter obtaining, archiving and analysing results
is easy and can be fully automatised
as will be demonstrated in section \ref{sec:examples}.

Once the SCF orbitals have been obtained,
the remainder of a calculation, \eg a Post-HF method,
can be formulated entirely in the SCF orbital basis
and without any reference to the underlying basis functions.
Therefore a basis-function independent SCF scheme automatically
leads to basis-function independent Post-HF methods as well.
In fact the aforementioned \python interface of \molsturm
makes it easy to re-use existing software modules
together with \molsturm's SCF.
In this manner we have already managed to link \molsturm to \pyscf~\cite{Sun2017}
for performing full configuration interaction~(FCI) calculations employing any of the
basis function types implemented in \molsturm.
Similarly a link between \molsturm and \adcman~\cite{Wormit2014}
for computing excited state energies at ADC(2),
ADC(2)-x and ADC(3)~\cite{Schirmer1982,Trofimov1999} level
has been established recently.
\molsturm is open-source and can be obtained from \url{https://molsturm.org}.

origin of the name

With respect to this, the name ``\molsturm'' is misleading
as the package did outgrow its original purpose to support
\textbf{mol}ecular calculations with so-called \textbf{Sturm}ian-type
basis functions.
