\noindent
When the \molsturm project~\cite{molsturmWeb} was initiated a couple of years back,
the original idea was to support \textbf{mol}ecular calculations
with \textbf{Sturm}ian-type basis functions
in the \contraction-based formulation we mentioned in section \vref{sec:BasisCS}.
Following my unsuccessful attempts on a finite-element-based Hartree-Fock scheme,
where I mostly used the approaches known to me from a \cGTO setting,
we expanded the goals of \molsturm.
Now the primary project goal has become to yield a quantum-chemistry
method development framework,
which supports the implementation and evaluation
of discretisations based on novel types of basis functions.
We have managed to achieve this
building largely on the conclusions
about the structure of \SCF algorithms
and the generality of the lazy matrix syntax of \lazyten,
which we discussed in the previous chapters.
Additionally \molsturm has been equipped with a powerful \python interface,
where it is easy to obtain, archive and analyse results.
Even implementing completely new features on top of \molsturm's \SCF procedure
often takes comparatively little development time as will be demonstrated.
The arguments and examples of this chapter follow
closely our publication~\cite{molsturmDesign}.
