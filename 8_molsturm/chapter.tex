\lazyten is the linear algebra interface of \molsturm.
It not only implements the lazy matrix datastructures,
which define the common interface of \gint and \gscf,
but further contains code to make standard external
iterative or direct solver implementations available
from a lazy matrices-based setting.

Similarly the eigensolvers can be accessed from \gscf via a common interface,
which abstracts the precise algorithm and allows \lazyten to make an automatic
choice by looking at the precise structure of the Fock matrix at hand.

This chapter follows closely the ideas we presented in \cite{molsturmDesign}.
