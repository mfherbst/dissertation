This chapter introduces the \molsturm program package~\cite{molsturmWeb}
following closely our publication~\cite{molsturmDesign}.
Many design aspects of \molsturm build and expand on the ideas
developed in the previous two chapters about \SCF methods
and \contraction-based algorithms
to overall
yield a highly flexible quantum-chemical method development framework.

One of the goals of \molsturm is to support the numerical requirements
of many types of basis functions and to provide a common ground
for experimentation.
A key ingredient to achieve this
is a \contraction-based \SCF procedure in the lazy matrix language of \lazyten.
As will be described in more detail in section \vref{sec:MolsturmDesign},
this allows to separate the \SCF implementation very well
from the details of the \contraction expression of the Fock matrix.
This in turn can be freely varied as needed from basis function type
to basis function type.
As a result the \SCF code is fully agnostic to the type of basis function used.

On top of this \molsturm provides a powerful \python interface
which allows to easily obtain, archive and analyse results,
implement new features or automatise repetitive processes.
Examples for this will be given in section \ref{sec:MolsturmExamples} below.
Additionally this interface makes it
convenient to re-use existing software modules
together with \molsturm's \SCF.
In this manner we have already managed to link \molsturm to \pyscf~\cite{Sun2017}
for performing full configuration interaction~(FCI) calculations
and recently \adcman~\cite{Wormit2014}
for computing excited state energies at \ADC(2),
\ADC(2)-x and \ADC(3)~\cite{Schirmer1982,Trofimov1999} level.

\molsturm is open-source software, licensed under the
GNU General Public License, and can be obtained from \url{https://molsturm.org}.
One should mention that the name ``\molsturm'' is somewhat misleading,
since the package has now outgrown its original purpose to support
\textbf{mol}ecular calculations with so-called \textbf{Sturm}ian-type
basis functions.
