\section{Capturing electronic correlation}
\label{sec:Correlation}

In the previous chapter we talked at length about the \HF approximation for solving
the non-relativistic electronic Schrödinger equation.
Since the search space for the variational minimisation is much more restricted compared
to the \FCI ansatz,
we necessarily make a larger approximation error in the \HF case.
Nevertheless it should be noted that \HF yields a rather good rank-1
approximation to the full Schrödinger problem,
where around $99\%$ of the \FCI energy~\cite{Jensen2007book} in a respective basis is obtained
at a fraction of the cost.
One might wonder
what part of the exact physical picture \HF is missing and how one could improve on that.

\subsection{What does Hartree-Fock miss?}
Even though the
Fock operator \eqref{eqn:FockOperator} describes a many-electron system
it is a one-particle operator,
since it only acts on single-electron functions.
The many-particle aspect is only treated via the Coulomb term \eqref{eqn:OperatorCoulomb}
and the exchange term \eqref{eqn:OperatorExchange},
where the interaction with
other electrons is included in the form of integrals over
the electron density $\rho_{\Theta^0}$ or the density matrix $\gamma_{\Theta^0}$.
Overall an electron thus does not see the exact position of all its neighbours
via the Fock matrix,
but only some kind of an average electron field.
In this sense the \HF ansatz is sometimes called a \newterm{mean-field approximation}.
In the light of this the \SCF can be thought of as an adjustment procedure,
where the electronic arrangement in the form of the occupied \SCF orbitals $\{\psi_i\}_{i\in\Iocc}$
is adjusted until their generated mean field
is no longer changing this arrangement,
\ie is self-consistent.

		circles over their respective orbits.
	}
	\label{fig:HFplanets}
\end{figure}
To visualise this issue better,
let us consider in analogy a planetary system,
where multiple planets are revolving around a central sun.
In the real system,
which is depicted on the left-hand side of figure \vref{fig:HFplanets},
the individual planets feel each other at all times
at their exact positions.
As a result their orbit around the sun is not a perfect circle but shows pronounced
wiggles due to the interaction between the planets.
In other words the motion of the planets around the sun is highly correlated.
In contrast to this the right-hand side
depicts the scenario drawn for the red planet in a \HF-like mean-field model.
Its neighbours are no longer visible at their exact positions,
much rather the red planet only amounts to interact with
some sort of smeared out particle density,
where their position is averaged over their complete orbits.
This interaction is almost as strong at all points
and thus the mean-field orbit of the red planet is much more smooth.

In the electronic system the situation is similar
in sense that the behaviour of individual electrons is indeed very much correlated.
Due to its mean-field nature the \HF ansatz
largely misses the description of this so-called \newterm{electron correlation}%
\footnote{%
	Conventionally one calls the \HF treatment of a chemical system
	the \emph{uncorrelated} treatment of the electronic structure.
	This is not perfectly sound in my opinion,
	as for example the Pauli principle is fulfilled in \HF.
	This implies for examples that two electron of the same spin
	cannot occupy the same orbital,
	which implies in turn that the motion
	of electrons of the same spin is at least to this extend correlated.
}.
In fact one typically refers to the difference
\begin{equation}
	E_0^{\text{corr}} = E_0^{\text{FCI}} - E_0^{\text{HF}}
	\label{eqn:EnergyCorrelation}
\end{equation}
between the \HF and \FCI energies in a particular basis set
as the \newterm{correlation energy}.
As mentioned before $E_0^{\text{corr}}$ is typically rather small
compared to $E_0^{\text{HF}}$.
Nevertheless the effects of the electron-electron are very important
for a proper description of the electronic structure of a chemical
system and can therefore in general not be neglected~\cite{Helgaker2013,Szabo1996,Jensen2007book}.

In practice one sometimes divides correlation effects
into two subclasses.
The first kind, the so-called \newterm{dynamic correlation},
is the aforementioned failure of the \HF approximation
to treat the communal, correlated motion of electrons properly.
The second kind, \newterm{static correlation},
occurs if the number of Slater determinants,
which is available for the description of a degenerate or near-degenerate
state is not sufficient.
For the \HF approximation,
where only one determinant for the description of the ground state
is available,
this defect becomes apparent in situations
with a low-lying excited state.
A classic example would be a molecule close to bond breaking.
In such a case the ground state resulting from a full CI treatment
has relevant contributions from more than one determinant.
As a result even the best \HF ground state determinant misses a substantial
part of the full CI ground state and thus only represents
a rather poor approximation.
In the remainder of this discussion about electron correlation
we will ignore static correlation and assume that a single determinant
\HF ground state is already a pretty decent description of the electronic structure.
Detailed discussions of so-called multi-reference
or multi-configurational methods tackling static correlation
can be found for example in \cite{McWeeny1985,Fischer1986,Jensen2007book,Helgaker2013}.

\subsection{Truncated configuration interaction expansion}
In section \vref{sec:FCI} about the \FCI method we already
mentioned that the exact ground state $\Psi_0$ to the electronic Schrödinger equation
can be expressed as a CI expansion \eqref{eqn:CIExpansion}%
\footnote{
	In this section about correlation methods,
	we will adhere to the usual index conventions
	of equations \eqref{eqn:CondOccIndex} and \eqref{eqn:CondVirtIndex}
	throughout.
}
\[
	\Psi_0
	= c_0 \Phi_0 + \sum_{ia} c_i^a \Phi_i^a
	+ \sum_{ij\,ab} c_{ij}^{ab} \Phi_{ij}^{ab}
	+ \sum_{\substack{ijk \\ abc}} c_{ijk}^{abc} \Phi_{ijk}^{abc}
	 + \cdots,
\]
starting from an arbitrary reference determinant $\Phi_0$.
A very natural choice for this is to take the reference
determinant to be the \HF ground state,
\ie the best single determinant for describing the electronic ground state.
In this way the
remaining contributions of the excited determinants $\Phi_i^a$,
$\Phi_{ij}^{ab}$, $\Phi_{ijk}^{abc}$, $\ldots$
can be expected to be small,
which makes it numerically more feasible to diagonalise
the \FCI matrix $\mat{A}_\text{FCI}$.
Furthermore this justifies truncating the CI expansion \eqref{eqn:CIExpansion}
prematurely to yield some sort of an intermediate approximation
between \HF and \FCI.
For example CISD, configuration interaction singles-doubles~\cite{Sherrill1999},
truncates the above expansion in a way that only singles and doubles
excitations are taken into account.
This would lead to the ansatz wave function
\[
	\Psi_0^\text{CISD}
	= \Phi_0 + \sum_{ia} c_i^a \Phi_i^a
	+ \sum_{ij\,ab} c_{ij}^{ab} \Phi_{ij}^{ab},
\]
where one assumes the individual determinants
are normalised in a way that $c_0 = 1$.

Even though truncated CI methods are conceptionally very simple,
they are not used much any more.
The main reason for this is the so-called \newterm{size-consistency problem}.
Unlike \FCI or \HF the CISD energy of two molecular fragments
is in general not additive,
even if these fragments do not interact.
Put more mathematically one can show~\cite{Helgaker2013} the following:
If $E_A$ is the energy corresponding to the CISD ground state $\Psi_0^\text{CISD}$
for a molecule $A$
and $E_B$ is the analogous energy for another molecule $B$,
then the CISD ground state energy $E_{AB}$
for a system consisting of both $A$ \emph{and} $B$
separated by an infinite distance is \emph{not} $E_A + E_B$.
One refers to this unphysical behaviour as \newterm{size-inconsistent}.
Including higher excitations
does not fix this problem,
such that all canonical truncated CI methods are size-inconsistent.
For the modelling of chemical reactions or even large molecules,
size-inconsistency is a major problem.
Nowadays better, size-consistent alternatives like the
coupled-cluster ansatz~(see below) exist
and are usually preferred.

Typically followed by a number to indicate the order.}
\subsection{Second order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory}
\label{sec:MP}

Starting from the reasonable
assumption that the \HF ground state determinant $\Phi_0$
is a very good approximation to the exact electronic ground state
it is a sensible ansatz to
employ Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory~\cite{Szabo1996,Helgaker2013}
and correct perturbatively for the missing correlation contribution
to the energy as well as the wave function.
one partitions the electronic Schrödinger Hamlitonian \eqref{eqn:ElectronicHamiltonian}
into
\[ \Op{H}_{\Nelec} = \Op{H}^0 + \Op{H}^1, \]
\ie a zeroth order Hamiltonian $\Op{H}^0$,
which is easy to compute,
and the perturbation $\Op{H}^1$,
which is the part missed in $\Op{H}^0$,
assumed to be small.

One way this partitioning can be achieved is Møller-Plesset
perturbation theory~\cite{Moeller1934},
where the unperturbed operator is taken to be the
direct sum of $\Nelec$ Fock operators
at the orbital configuration corresponding to the \HF ground state $\Phi_0$,
\begin{align*}
	\Op{H}^0 &= \bigoplus_{i=1}^{\Nelec} \Op{F}_{\Theta^0},
	\intertext{
and the perturbation is}
	\Op{H}^1 &= \Op{V}_{ee} - \bigoplus_{i=1}^{\Nelec} \left( \Op{J}_{\Theta^0} + \Op{K}_{\Theta^0} \right),
\end{align*}
\ie whatever the \HF operator misses.
In the discretised setting of a finite-dimensional basis set
$\{\varphi_\mu\}_{\mu\in\Nbas}$
one may easily derive the zeroth to second order
energy contributions~\cite{Szabo1996}
\begin{align*}
	E_0^0 &= \sum_i \varepsilon_i \\
	E_0^1 &= - \frac12 \sum_{ij} \eriAsym{ij}{ij}  \\
	E_0^2 &= \frac14 \sum_{ijab} \frac{\abs{\eriAsym{ij}{ab}}^2}
						{\varepsilon_i + \varepsilon_j - \varepsilon_a - \varepsilon_b}
\end{align*}
to the ground state energy.
In other words up to zeroth order we obtain the sum of the orbital energies.
The first order correction accounts for the double counting
of the electron-electron interactions and recovers the \HF energy expression.
The first real improvement to \HF is obtained
at \newterm{second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory}~({\MP}2).
For reasons, which will become clear in the next section
one often introduces the so-called \newterm{$T_2$ amplitude}
\[ t_{ij}^{ab} \equiv \frac{\eriAsym{ij}{ab}}
		{\varepsilon_i + \varepsilon_j - \varepsilon_a - \varepsilon_b}
\]
and writes the {\MP}2 energy as
\[ E_0^\text{MP2} = E_0^\text{HF} + \frac14 \sum_{ijab} \cc{\eriAsym{ij}{ab}} t_{ij}^{ab}. \]
The \MP methods do in general have some issues as well.
Most notably the perturbation expansion of energies does in general
not converge~\cite{Helgaker2013},
making it hard to properly justify these methods from a mathematical basis.
In practice {\MP}2 is still vividly employed,
mainly because it gives a decent guess
towards the exact energy of the electronic ground state
at manageable computational cost%
\footnote{Using sensible approximations linear-scaling {\MP}2 is possible.}.

One should mention that due to its perturbative nature,
there is no guarantee that $E_0^\text{MP2} \geq E_0^\text{exact}$,
the exact ground state energy of the electronic Schrödinger equation \eqref{eqn:ElectronicSchrödinger}.
In the community of quantum chemistry one often refers
to this fact as {\MP}2 being non-variational.
This saying is, however, a bit inaccurate,
since the method {\MP}2 is indeed variational
in the sense that larger basis sets will always lead a lower-energy {\MP}2 ground state,
which is furthermore closer to the exact {\MP}2 ground state wave function.
This is not that much apparent in the outlined derivation,
but can be seen from an alternative route
employing the Hylleraas functional~\cite{Helgaker2013}.
In contrast it is not variational in the sense that
a larger basis yields an {\MP}2 energy
which approaches $E_0^\text{exact}$ from above.

\subsection{Coupled-cluster theory}
\defineabbr{CC}{CC\xspace}{Coupled cluster}
\label{sec:CC}

The main idea of coupled-cluster theory
is to employ a more elaborate ansatz for generating a limited amount
of excited determinants with the overall aim to
reach a size-consist method.
In this work coupled-cluster only plays a minor role.
This section will therefore be limited to the absolutely necessary
steps to get the rough idea.
For a more thorough introduction the reader is directed
to the excellent review by \citet{Crawford2007}
as well as numerous other works~\cite{Helgaker2013,Hodecker2016}
dealing with the topic.

In coupled-cluster theory one employs the so-called exponential ansatz
\begin{equation}
	\Psi^\text{CC} = \exp(\op{T}) \Phi_0
	\label{eqn:AnsatzCC}
\end{equation}
to generate the coupled-cluster wave function $\Psi^\text{CC}$
from a \HF reference determinant $\Phi_0$.
In this equation
\[ \op{T} = \op{T}_1 + \op{T}_2 + \cdots + \op{T}_{\Nelec} \]
is the \newterm{excitation operator}
consisting of all singles excitations
\begin{align*}
	\op{T}_1 &= \sum_{ia} t_i^a \op{\tau}_i^a
	&&\text{with $\op{\tau}_i^a$ defined, such that}& \Phi_i^a &= \op{\tau}_i^a \Phi_0, \\
\intertext{all doubles excitations}
	\op{T}_2 &= \sum_{ijab} t_{ij}^{ab} \op{\tau}_{ij}^{ab}
		&&\text{with}& \Phi_{ij}^{ab} &= \op{\tau}_{ij}^{ab} \Phi_0, \\
\intertext{all triples}
	\op{T}_3 &= \sum_{\substack{ijk \\ abc}} t_{ijk}^{abc} \op{\tau}_{ijk}^{abc}
		&&\text{with}& \Phi_{ijk}^{abc} &= \op{\tau}_{ijk}^{abc} \Phi_0, \\
\end{align*}
and so forth.
In a similar notation to \eqref{eqn:ExpansionSlaterDeterminant}
the excitation operator is often directly written as a sum of excitations
$\op{\tau}_i^a$, $\op{\tau}_{ij}^{ab}$, $\op{\tau}_{ijk}^{abc}$ \ldots as
\[ \op{T} = \sum_\mu t_\mu \op{\tau}_\mu, \]
where $\mu$ is an appropriately chosen multi-index.

Plugging \eqref{eqn:AnsatzCC} into the variational expression
for the ground state energy
\[ E_0^\text{CC} = \inf_{t_\mu} \frac{\braket{\Psi^\text{CC}}{\Op{H}_{\Nelec} \Psi^\text{CC}}_{\Nelec}}
	{\braket{\Psi^\text{CC}}{\Psi^\text{CC}}_{\Nelec}}
\]
is hard to solve
even for truncated cases where $\op{T} = \op{T}_1 + \op{T}_2$ only, say,
due to the non-linearities in the $t_\mu$
so this is usually not done

Instead insert ansatz into electronic Schrödinger equation
\[ \Op{H}_{\Nelec} \exp(\op{T}) \Phi_0 = E_0 \exp(\op{T}) \Phi_0 \]
Introduce similarity-transformed Hamiltonian
\[ \Op{H}_T = \exp(-\op{T}) \Op{H}_{\Nelec} \exp(\op{T}) \]
to write
\begin{align*}
	\mbra{\Phi_0} \Op{H}_T \mket{\Phi_0} &= E \\
	\mbra{\Phi_\mu} \Op{H}_T \mket{\Phi_0} &= 0
\end{align*}
where
\[ \Phi_\mu = \op{\tau}_\mu \Phi_0, \]
Projection ansatz not exact.
Number of projections equals number of excitations to consider.
