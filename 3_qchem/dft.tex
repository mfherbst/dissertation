\defineabbr{DFT}{DFT\xspace}{Density-functional theory}
In this section we want to briefly look at a slightly different
approach towards modelling the electronic structure.
Instead of solving for the wave function $\Psi_I$ associated to the
$I$-th eigenstate of the electronic Hamiltonian $\Op{H}_{\Nelec}$,
we will solve for the state's electronic density $\rho_I$ directly instead.

The rationale for this is twofold.
Firstly the density contains all information about the chemical system.
The integral
\[ \int_{\R^3} \rho(\vec{r}) \D\vec{r} \]
evaluates to the number of electrons $\Nelec$
and via Kato's cusp condition~\cite{Kato1951} one may obtain the nuclear
charges $Z_A$ via the derivatives of the electron density at the cusp points.
Secondly the Hohnberg-Kohn theorems~\cite{Hohenberg1964}
provide a unique identification between a particular electron density
and the potential, which generates this density.
