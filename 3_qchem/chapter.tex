The word ``reality'' is also a word,
a word which we must learn to use correctly.}

I am convinced that despite his slightly positivist language,
Bohr believes as much as we do in the reality of phenomena of
which he speaks, and then the difference between the views
of Bohr and mine is more a difference of language than a
difference of content.}{Vladimir Fock~(1898--1974)}

\noindent
This chapter is concerned with the generalisation
of the one-electron hydrogen-like Schrödinger Hamiltonian \eqref{eqn:OpHydrogen}
\[
	\Op{H}_H = -\frac12 \Delta - \frac{Z}{r},
\]
which we discussed in section \vref{sec:HydrogenAtom},
towards the many-body problems of quantum chemistry.

Even though the spectral properties are very similar to the hydrogen-like case,
solving the associated time-independent
Schrödinger equation \eqref{eqn:TISE} analytically for
any but the most trivial problems is impossible.
Most of this chapter will therefore be devoted to
discussing approximations to the exact \TISE
as well as numerical approaches for solving such approximations
in practice.
