There is a race between the increasing complexity of the
systems we build and our ability to develop intellectual
tools for understanding their complexity.
If the race is won by our tools, then systems will eventually
become easier to use and more reliable.
If not, they will continue to become harder to use and less
reliable for all but a relatively small set of common tasks.
Given how hard thinking is, if those intellectual tools are
to succeed, they will have to substitute calculation
for thought.}{Leslie Lamport~(1941--present)}

\noindent
Summarised in one sentence the basic idea of \contraction-based algorithms
is to avoid storing large tensors in memory
and instead employ highly optimised
\contraction expressions of this tensor with other tensors for computations.
We already saw in the previous chapter that applying
such a strategy to the Fock matrix resulting from a \FE-based
or a \CS-based discretisation of the \HF problem
can lead to an improved formal computational scaling
making the \contraction-based approach rather promising in those cases.
\contraction-based algorithms are, however,
not limited to \SCF procedures or quantum-chemical calculations.

This chapter will give a general introduction into
the concept of \contraction-based algorithms,
contrasting them with traditional approaches,
where the matrices are stored in memory.
Closely connected to \contraction-based approaches is the concept of lazy matrices,
which is a direct generalisation to the traditional matrix concept
in the form of a domain-specific language for \contraction-based algorithms.
Most importantly this implies that algorithms programmed
with lazy matrices can automatically
be used with dense matrices or in a \contraction-based fashion without change to the code.
A preliminary \cpp implementation of lazy matrices
is available in the \lazyten library,
which focuses predominantly on user-friendliness and flexibility
in the computational back-end.
We will demonstrate by the means of examples.

	\end{itemize}
}

In the specialised context where one wants to avoid storing
large matrices during an iterative diagonalisation
or when solving a linear system,
this idea is all but new.
Already \citet{Davidson1975} suggested in his celebrated paper
about the Davidson diagonalisation method
to completely avoid storing the CI matrix when solving for the
lowest eigenvalues of a large CI or Full-CI matrix.
Instead he suggested to employ an expression for computing
the application of said CI matrix to some trial eigenvectors.
Recently matrix-free methods~\cite{Kronbichler2012}
for solving partial differential equations
in a finite-element discretisation
have become popular as well.
These similarly employ well-crafted expressions for matrix-vector
products instead of building the \FE system matrix in memory.



Replace working on matrices stored in memory
by matrix or tensor contraction
like matrix-vector multiplication
\contraction-based method or \contraction-based algorithm
other names matrix-free or apply-based

\begin{itemize}
	\item In some cases 
	\item SCF (and many other methods) use iterative solvers
	\item They only need application or contraction of matrices
	\item Can furthermore reduce scaling as we have seen
	\item Typically matrix expression composed of many terms and dependent (with variations) on the problem we want to solve.
	\item But expressions may become complicated:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Requirements of individual matrix terms differ in storage scheme, contraction scheme
			\item What to do in terms of approximations, matrix properties and the cost per application differs
		\end{itemize}
	\item[$\Rightarrow$] Contraction expression complicated to code
	\item[$\Rightarrow$] We would like to stay flexible
\end{itemize}


In a \contraction-based ansatz most of the complexity is effectively
encoded in the actual contraction of the Fock matrix with a trial vector.
Consider for example equations \eqref{eqn:ExchangeApply}
and \eqref{eqn:ApplicationKcs},
which already in the presented form are are all but simple expressions.
Since this matrix-vector product is required in the most costly step
of the \SCF iteration,
which is typically an iterative diagonalisation or an iterative optimisation,
it overall determines the runtime of the complete procedure.
Thus this matrix-vector product needs to be implemented very efficiently,
making the expressions even more complex in practice.
A good layer of abstraction between the actual \SCF algorithm
and the implementation of the matrix-vector contractions
is therefore highly desirable to enable flexibility on both sides.



\subsection{Advantages and disadvantages of \contraction schemes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Scaling typically reduced in examples to O(N)
	\item Parallelisation is easier (less data management)
	\item Hardware trends in favour: figure \vref{fig:MemCpuSpeedup}
	%
	\item Matrices more intuitive than dealing with contraction functions
	\item More computations (FLOPS) are needed
	\item Schemes need to be efficient and highly parallelisable
	\item Algorithms typically become more complicated (bookkeeping)
\end{itemize}

\section{Lazy matrices}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Define
		\item how it works
		\item what it solves
		\item In the context of HF
	\end{itemize}
}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Lazy matrices defined in contrast to stored matrices
	\item Stored matrices: Everything resides in memory
	\item Lazy matrices: Generalisation which lifts this restriction
	\item Only a shell which looks like a matrix, but internally only contains expressions
	\item Subject to lazy evaluation
	\item Everything is delayed until \contraction with vector
	\item For convenience: All matrix operations (including element retrieval) allowed.
\end{itemize}

Let $\mat{U}$ and $\mat{A}$ be lazy matrices and $\vec{x}$ be a normal vector.
We wish to compute the expression
\[ (\mat{I} - \mat{U} \tp{\mat{U}}) \mat{A} (\mat{I} - \mat{U} \tp{\mat{U}}) \vec{x} \]
which occurs in Jacobi-Davidson procedure.
A typical code is
\begin{lstlisting}
DiagonalMatrix<matrix_type> I(std::vector<scalar_type>(100, 1));
auto projector = I - U * transpose(U);
auto mat = projector * A * projector;
auto res = mat * x
\end{lstlisting}

\todoil{Maybe illustrate the points mentioned here using the coulomb and exchange matrices as actual examples}

% TODO a good paragraph for this part:
Whenever operations are done on a matrix \lazyten does not automatically
evaluate them in all cases.
Much rather it usually just builds up a datastructure,
which keeps track of the operations which \textit{should} be done
at some point in the future.
Whenever an actual call to the \contraction-function happens,
the expression history is considered and evaluated with respect
to the other arguments supplied by the \contraction call.
% end TODO

% For the design chapter it is important to mention here that \contraction-based methods
% are a generalisation of non-contraction based methods.

\todoil{Maybe this section is too long given that we want to publish on this again}

As mentioned above for some basis function types it is advantageous
to not build the coulomb and exchange matrices in memory,
but instead only use them in the form of matrix-vector applications.
Since iterative solvers like Krylov-subspace based methods or Davidson's algorithm
only need the matrix-vector product in order to find a few of the eigenvalues
of a particular matrix,
this is not an issue with respect to the eigenproblem which needs to be solved
as part of the SCF.
Note, that this approach is furthermore not new in quantum chemistry at all.
Other examples where one typically avoids to place the matrix to diagonalise
into memory are the configuration interaction~(CI) matrix
or the algebraic-diagrammatic construction~(ADC) matrix to name a few.

We shall refer to algorithms which focus on implementing a matrix-vector product
instead of the full matrix as \contraction-based algorithms.

This concept has been invented many times
and has hence been called a number of different things
in the different communities.
Other names include \texttt{matrix}-free
\todoil{papers from Kronbichler}
or apply-based
\todoil{papers from Michi Wormit}


The latter name is supposed to indicate that such a scheme is in principle
not only restricted to the case of multiplying a matrix with a vector,
much rather general tensor contractions could be expressed implicitly
by the means of a function computing the contraction rather than
by explicitly performing the contraction form tensor elements
which reside in memory.
\todoil{Also mention the term \texttt{apply}-based?
Check what term is used in literature.
Michi Wormit's thesis uses matrix-vector product as term for ADC
}
% Yes mention them all.

Note that a disadvantage of \contraction-based algorithms is that the expressions
computing the tensor contraction can become rather complicated.
Furthermore it usually is more intuitive to think of the
numerical modelling in terms of tensors, matrices and vectors
rather than \contraction functions.
For this purpose we generalise the concept of a matrix
to so-called \term{lazy matrix} objects.
Whilst a normal or \term{stored matrix} is dense and has all its elements
residing in memory,
a lazy matrix is more general.
It may follow a particular sparse storage scheme
like compressed-row storage
or even more general all its elements may just be arbitrary expressions.
The values of lazy matrices are hence only computed upon request
or whenever a contraction with another object is required.
As such the lazy matrix may have, \ie a special \update function
may be used to modify the expression of the lazy matrix
at a later point.
Note, however, that special storage schemes for storing
sparse matrices are similarly just lazy matrices 
\todoil{
	Updating lazy matrices is a bit like reactive programming
	\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming}.
	In fact one could use them to get reactive programming
	into C++ in a simple way.
	Mention this here (or in the \lazyten paper)
}

This on the one hand makes obtaining the lazy matrix elements
expensive, but on the other hands gives a nice matrix-like
interface to more complicated objects.
All evaluation between lazy matrices
(i.e. addition or matrix-matrix multiplication)
is usually delayed until for example a contraction of the resulting
expression with a vector is performed.
One typically refers to this strategy as \term{lazy evaluation}.

Since lazy matrices are a straight generalisation
of usual matrices,
all algorithms written in terms of lazy matrices
are at the same time applicable to dense matrices,
sparse matrices or special matrices like in the case of Sturmians
where a lazy evaluation scheme is needed.
So high-level code written in terms of lazy matrices
does not need to be changed if the low level matrix implementation
is changed from one basis function type to another.

	    but I would leave it for the \lazyten paper}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Builds up DAG instead of evaluating
	\item Evaluation is done delayed upon \contraction
	
\end{itemize}

Fazit
\begin{itemize}
	\item contraction based algorithms may lead to lower memory footprint and
		hence to improved scaling
	\item Code can be more readable if if proper abstraction is used
	\item Good for teaching and for experimentation
	\item Abstraction between integrals and SCF algorithms
	\item Plug and play integrals libraries (see next chapter)
	\item Basis-type independent SCF / quantum chemistry
\end{itemize}


designed to add lazy matrix support to existing
linear algebra packages.
It effectively provides a layer of abstraction between the code
describing the algorithms


In the previous chapter we already mentioned
how similar ideas can reduce the formal
computational scaling of the \SCF procedure
for certain kinds of discretisations
and additionally could even lead to a basis-function
agnostic \SCF.
