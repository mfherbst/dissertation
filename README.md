# Dissertation

This repository contains the TeX and python source code to build
my PhD thesis.
Work in progress, please wait ;).

Please not that whilst the compiled thesis and its content is released
under CC-by-sa the source code by itself is released under the GPL3.

Building the thesis makes heavy use of [`molsturm`](https://molsturm.org)
and [`gint`](https://molsturm.org/gint) to dynamically build the
plots and tables, so these programs need to be installed for a succesful built.
