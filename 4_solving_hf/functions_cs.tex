% Sturmians form a complete basis for H^2(R^3) and for H^1(R^1) (only the radial part)

% complete but not over-complete

In previous work we have investigated the use of so-called generalised Sturmians as basis functions
in electronic structure theory.
%
\newcommand{\rpack}{\vec{r}_1, \ldots, \vec{r}_N}
Generalised Sturmians $\Phi_\nu(\rpack)$ are the solutions to $N$-body Schr√∂dinger-like equation
\begin{equation}
	\left( -\frac12 \sum_{j=1}^N \Delta_j + \beta_\nu V_0(\rpack) - E \right) \Phi_\nu(\rpack) = 0
	\label{eqn:GenSturm}
\end{equation}
where $V_0(\rpack)$ is
a zero-th order potential.

In case of atoms a good choice is the nuclear attraction:
The electrostatic electron-nucleus interaction
\[
	V_0(\rpack) = - \sum_{j=1}^N \frac{Z}{r_j}.
\]
\todo[inline]{Is many nuclei also possible here?}
Note that the electron-nucleus interaction is scaled by the factor $\beta_\nu$ in \eqref{eqn:GenSturm}
such that the solutions $\Phi_\nu(\rpack)$ all become isoenergetic.
This makes Sturmians reproduce the correct long-range decay behaviour of the electron density
as well as properly represent the nuclear cusp at the core.
As such the functional form of generalised Sturmians is very much related to STOs.
Unlike STOs the two-electron integrals can, however, be reformulated in a particular way
to make computing them less demanding.
This requires, however, that the mathematical properties of the Sturmians
can be fully exploited during the computation,
which in turn requires the Fock matrix to be arranged in a specific way.
Moreover it is advantageous to not build the coulomb and exchange matrix in memory at all,
but much rather only use these matrices in the form of matrix-vector products,
since this overall saves an order of magnitude in the computational scaling.


Coulomb-Sturmian basis function is composed of
\[ \varphi_\mu(\vec{r}) = \]

% TODO Things to show:
%    - The larger n, the larger the energy under the action of the fock operator
%    - HF Kinetic energy scales with k: Lower if k lower
%    - HF Nuclear attraction energy scales with k: Higher if k lower
%    - HF electron-electron interaction scales with k: Lower if k lower
% Refer to these results in the chapter about Sturmian calculations
