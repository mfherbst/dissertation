% Use as an example to explain the ideas of finite elements
An important equation from classical electrodynamics which
involves the Laplace operator is Poisson's equation
\begin{equation}
	\Delta V_H(\vec{r}) = \rho(\vec{r})
	\label{eqn:Poisson}
\end{equation}
relating the potential to the charge density $\rho$ which generates it.

% TODO 
%  Note that norm wrt fock operator F is equivalent to H1 norm due to Laplace part
%  Lipschitz continuity
%  well-posedness

% TODO Talk about convergence rates?
