\section{Takeaway}
\label{sec:SCFtakeaway}
The \SCF algorithms we discussed in this section all follow the general scheme,
where a \textbf{Fock update} step and
a \textbf{coefficient update} or \textbf{density matrix update}
step are repetitively executed.
In the former step a new Fock matrix $\mat{F}^{(n)}$ is constructed from
the present set of \SCF coefficients $\mat{C}^{(n)}$
or the present density matrix $\mat{D}^{(n)}$.
In the latter step this Fock matrix $\mat{F}^{(n)}$,
perhaps with additional insight gained in previous iterations,
is used in order to generate a new set of coefficients $\mat{C}^{(n+1)}$.
For Roothaan's repeated diagonalisation,
the optimal damping algorithm and the geometric direct minimisation algorithm
this sequence of steps is emphasised in figures
\vref{fig:RoothaanODA} and \vref{fig:GeometricDirectMinimisation},
where the Fock update step is highlighted in red
and the coefficient/density update step in blue in each case.
Motivated by the deviating structure of the aforementioned
algorithms I consider it reasonable
to assume that all \SCF algorithms can be thought of in such
a two-step process.

Another key result in this chapter is
that different basis function types give rise to
different numerical structure
of the quantities involved in the \SCF procedure.
We focused most on the Fock matrices
of contracted Gaussian, finite-element and Coulomb-Sturmian discretisations,
which are shown in figures
\vref{fig:StructureGaussianFock},
\vref{fig:StructureFiniteElementFock}
and \vref{fig:StructureSturmianFock}.
These matrices differ both in size as well as in sparsity.
Both for \FE-based as well as \CS-based
discretisations a \contraction-based ansatz%
\footnote{See the next chapter for a proper introduction into the concept
of \contraction-based methods.},
where one avoids building the Fock matrix at all
and instead thinks in terms of matrix-vector applications,
showed noteworthy improvements in formal computational scaling.

As we will discuss in depth in the next chapter
a \contraction-based ansatz can be thought of as a generalisation
of a scheme keeping the matrices in memory.
This suggests targeting a \contraction-based \SCF scheme to achieve
maximum generality of the \SCF algorithm
and potentially independence of the \SCF code from
the basis function type in a quantum chemistry program.

As mentioned before this implies to formulate the \SCF in terms of coefficients
to exploit the favourable computational scaling
for some basis function types like the \FE or the \CS functions.
We indicated for the \ODA algorithm
how approximations allow to transform this density-based
\SCF into the \tODA scheme,
which can be formulated as a \contraction-based \SCF.
In section \vref{sec:OverviewSCF} we furthermore gave more general suggestions,
which allow to transform every density-based \SCF
into a coefficient-based \SCF in theory.
We therefore believe it to be possible
to construct an efficient \contraction-based \SCF,
which is agnostic to the type of basis function used
and where one is able to switch between
multiple algorithms depending on the numerical requirements of the basis functions
as well as the chemical system.
This in turn opens the door
for achieving a single quantum-chemistry program,
which is in theory compatible with every type of basis function.
We will present such a program in chapter \vref{ch:Molsturm}.
