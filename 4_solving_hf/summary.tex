\section{Summarising remarks}

% Basis-type independence of SCF algorithms}
% concluding remark for this chapter

Fock matrix not diagonal dominant

SCFs all fit into Fock update - coefficient update
In theory independent of basis function type
In light of apply expressions of exchange for \FE and \CS
and complexity of some \SCF algorithm 
coding apply expressions into \SCF schemes can become cumbersome
and non-intuitive
\contract-based \SCF hard to achieve?

Such results hold for \HF and with minor modifications for \DFT

but if Basis-function independent \SCF can be achieved
basis-type independent quantum chemistry is within reach

% Show schematic with Fock update - coefficient update
%     in red and blue as in paper
% Refer to appropriate equations from more detailed considerations in SCF
% algorithms chapter.
% TODO This could fit into the introductory part of the SCF algorithm
% section or in the conclusion part of it as well
