\chapter{Estimating the CBS limit for UHF}
\label{apx:CbsLimit}
No UHF literature values found.
Makes sense since RHF is real HF and UHF is ficiticious.
Go into that a little.
Apparently already Hylleraas\cite{Hylleraas1929} has some idea that this could
happen if the spatial components of the spin are not the same any more
says \cite{Mestechkin1981}


% Here the old versions of cc-pvNz is used of molsturm and libint
We follow \cite{Jensen2005} and use cc-pvNz basis set families
using the builtin procedure of \molsturm.
